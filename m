Yes, I understand that and I agree.  We *do* have tools to
verify DT files against bindings, and at least in this
domain we don't have tools to verify against the RISC-V
specs.

But barring that, we can define the DT binding and try to
ensure it exactly matches the RISC-V specs.

OK I concede that encoding the logic in the DT binding is
a good practical solution and I take back my suggestion.

This is exactly what I wanted your opinion on.  I mean, I
already agreed with this statement, but the existence of a
different (RISC-V) spec as a source of truth made me consider
that maybe it wasn't DT's job to validate some things.

My point was about DT binding logic versus kernel code logic.  But
yes I agree with what you're saying here.

The main things I take away from this discussion:
- DT bindings *should* encode constraints for RISC-V extensions
   to enforce certain requirements from their underlying RISC-V
   specifications.
- The reason to do this is that the DT tools we have can help
   ensure correctness.  And doing it in the binding means it can
   get reviewed once, and the logic will apply to all DTS files
   that adhere to the binding.
- Doing some validation in the kernel is still useful, but anything
   done there needs to replicated in any other code bases that need
   to parse DT files.
- Conor owns this mess. :)
