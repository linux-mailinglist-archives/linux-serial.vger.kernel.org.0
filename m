IRQ latency is influenced by lots of things like CPU frequency and idle
behavior and the involved drivers on a specific SoC, as they might
disable interrupt processing for too long.

To test the hypothesis you can enable CONFIG_IRQSOFF_TRACER and then
see if you find any smoking gun by running your testcase with this
tracer enabled.
