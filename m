Commenting out the above line brought some improvement.  In minicom with a
loopback connector in place, the first byte sent does not get echoed
back at all.  However, all other bytes are echoed as soon as they are sent.

The kernel used for the above test was 672c0c5 (5.18-rc5), which is the most
recent I can conveniently get onto the test machine at present.  I tested
the unmodified kernel before commenting out the line and confirmed that it
exhibited the full fault condition (bytes come back in blocks of 32).

Chip revision is 0x27.
