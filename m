Thanks for the report. Do you maybe mean 6.5-rc1 instead of 6.6-rc1 above?

If so, I suspect the issue you are reporting got already fixed during the
-rc cycle for v6.5 kernel.

Can you please test with v6.5 kernel? It has the two fixes below that
sounds like you may have been missing:

a4a79e03bab5 ("serial: core: Revert port_id use")
04c7f60ca477 ("serial: core: Fix serial core port id, including multiport devices")

Note how commit a4a79e03bab5 already did a partial revert of what you're
suggesting.

If you already have these two commits, then let's investigate further to
see what might be still wrong.

Regards,

Tony
