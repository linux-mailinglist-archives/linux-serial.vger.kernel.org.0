Okay, that also worked great, thanks a lot. It gives something concrete to 
work with to find a fix.

The commit itself looks very much correct, however, my guess is that when 
serial8250_rx_dma_flush() does dmaengine_pause() dma_status somehow 
does not become DMA_PAUSED which leads to not properly flushing DMA Rx 
transaction. Can you try the following debug patch (if my guess is 
correct, besides triggering the WARN_ON_ONCE, it also works around the 
issue):

[PATCH] DEBUG: 8250_dma: Detect DMA_PAUSED vs DMA_IN_PROGRESS inconsistency

Detect DMA state not returning DMA_PAUSED after dmaengine_pause() was
issued.

Not intended for upstream.
