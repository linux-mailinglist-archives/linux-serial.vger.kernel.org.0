I'm OK with those being enabled. Though, I hope "not registering tty0"
wasn't an explicit decision, but maybe an oversight/trade-off due to
assuming SPCR code will only run on servers without displays (where tty0
wouldn't matter). (I understand it might be too late to change that.)

So I'd want the 2nd column to be: tty0(EC) ttyAMA0(E) at best, and
ttyAMA0(EC) tty0(E) at worst.

I like the fact that this one has tty0. For example, Debian's installer
iterates over /proc/consoles and launches itself on all the consoles it
finds there, so it wouldn't launch on my chromebook's screen if tty0
wasn't included (just like it doesn't launch on a QEMU aarch64 VM's
framebuffer).

I think things run roughly in the following order (from what I can
decipher from kernel messages) and I think it matches your explanations:

|            ACPI SPCR            |      dt chosen stdout-path      |
+=================================+=================================+
| acpi_parse_spcr()               |                                 |
| -> add_preferred_console(uart0) |                                 |
|    (if not on x86)              |                                 |
+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+
|                        console_setup()                            |
|                        -> add_preferred_console(tty0)             |
|                           (if console=tty0)                       |
+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+
|                        register_console(vt)                       |

|                                 |    (if no console arg)          |

OK. Assuming these changes won't go any further, maybe I'll try
documenting the current behavior in relevant places.

Maybe I can get QEMU's SPCR use conditional on the existence a
framebuffer, and get distributions to remove stdout-path from certain
device-trees; but that would disable the serial console completely
(instead of having it enabled where tty0 is still preferred).

This works; but I'd have to know the machine's serial configuration in
advance to put it in the cmdline as "console=<serial> console=tty0", or
lose the serial console as in the above. (A "console=dt" like that
"console=spcr" patch you linked to would be useful here if it existed.)

Both seem imperfect in that sense, but tolerable.

Thanks for the detailed reply.
