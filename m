Ack, will fix for v2 (as well as the related ones below).

genpd_lock() is not part of the public API, which is why I did it like 
this. This gets decided by whether the GENPD_FLAG_IRQ_SAFE flag is set, 
so it should be a mutex in this case, as that is not set.

Hm, yeah, I wonder if we'll hit that use case. Probably not, though. I 
mostly expect our drivers to only reset devices on initial probe or in 
some kind of panic recovery scenario, not while doing PM stuff.

It's a bit confusing. Apple calls these registers "ps" registers, which 
presumably stands for "power state". They can both clockgate and 
powergate devices (where supported), as well as enable auto-PM and also 
handle reset. So they're a bit more complex and higher level than a 
simple power domain, which is why I called the driver "pwrstate", since 
it controls the power state of a specific SoC domain or block. In fact, 
the device PM is controlled via a 4-bit power state index, though right 
now only 0, 4, 15 are used (power gated, clock gated, active). Many 
devices will not support individual power gating and would just 
clockgate at 0, and right now the driver never uses 4, but might in the 
future. If that needs to be exposed to consumers, then it'd have to be 
via genpd idle states.
