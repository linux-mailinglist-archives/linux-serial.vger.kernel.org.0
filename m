OK thanks for checking.

Ah OK sorry I misunderstood.

If you are not using modprobe, and have CONFIG_SERIAL_CORE=m, you
need to load serial_base.ko. I don't think we can build the core stuff as
as serial_core.ko without renaming serial_core.c to something else. Looks
like your config has SERIAL_CORFE built-in though, and without the serial
core stuff you'd likely get "Unknown symbol in module" error loading
8250_exar.

Well I guess you could check the patches applied to that kernel, but
presumably it's v6.5 for that part.

Maybe check if rmmod 8250_exar now somehow causes the following insmod
8250_exar attempts to fail?

OK yeah thanks, not seeing anything wrong early in the dmesg.
