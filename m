Yes, there is FPGA framework, which handles FPGA re-configuration.
There is no FPGA re-configuration in the driver and neither in the
system. The FPGA does not even support re-configuration. The FPGA is
just a variant to implement a PCIe target. The FPGA loads its
configuration on power up once from flash before the BIOS starts. So
the operating system does not need to know that it is an FPGA. It is
just a PCIe target.

Why not 8250_dfl? Because this is a driver for a different IP core.
The UART is no Altera/Intel or AMD/Xilinx IP core. It is a KEBA
IP core and the 8250_keba driver only implements feature added by
KEBA. The rest is 8250 and uses the 8250 infrastructure.

Like first, it is just a PCIe target and this PCIe target is divided
into auxiliary devices, which was suggested by gregkh. Initially I
divided it into platform devices, but the suggestion of gregkh is a
better fit. It is a single PCIe target, which consists of multiple
logical devices with its own registers and interrupts. This logical
devices are then separated by auxiliary devices.

3 years ago Intel was not able to deliver enough FPGAs. With just being
a PCIe target, it was possible to switch the FPGA vendor without
touching the software in the field. With Linux re-configuring the FPGA
that would not have been possible. So re-configuring FPGAs during
runtime is something that should be only used if needed.

> Can you elaborate on these considerations?

I hope you get a better impression what this is about. For the drivers
it is not relevant that the device is FPGA based.
