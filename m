Yes, it does not apply. I've just added stable@ in cc so you're aware
that 5.10 and 5.15 still have a problem with the serial code (and in
case you have an opinion between trying to backport this big patch or
reverting a bunch of older ones)

The quote is just context.

I can try to backport it and send it properly if Lukas doesn't have
time, but it doesn't hurt to discuss first.

Thanks,
