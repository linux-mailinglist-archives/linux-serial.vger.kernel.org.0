That's a fair point, but there are some use cases that use CPU Isolation on 
top of PREEMPT_RT in order to reduce interference on a CPU running an RT 
workload.

For those cases, IIRC the handler will run on a different (housekeeping) 
CPU when those IRQs originate on an Isolated CPU, meaning the above 
described cacheline bouncing is expected.

Now it makes a lot more sense to me.

Ok, fair point.
But if we disable it, we end up not having even those few successes.

But now that I understand the point is preventing the CPU from hogging, it 
makes sense: we prefer disabling the interrupt than compomising the system.
It also makes a warning that may help to track down the driver/device 
issue.

Sure, I will give it a try.

Now having a better understanding of what is expected here, I will also try 
to experiment a little here.

Thank you!
