I have the problem with 5.19.8 on x86_64

Yes, please

The delock card is in an x86 machine, and it communicates with various RS232 devices
(hence speeds above 230400 usually works badly with a few meters of cabling)

The problem I have, is that the baudrate is very much off at the lower ranges I'm interested in
(2400-115200 mostly), even though the register values seems to make sense.
