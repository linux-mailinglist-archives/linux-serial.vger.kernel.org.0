There is no fixed major number for uartps which is not the case for
uartlite.
It means from description you can see that every uartps instance is
getting different major number and also different minor number.
I am aware about this and it was also described. I have one issue
regarding this flying around. But thinking to save non 0 major number
after first registration and pass it to other instances to avoid this
behavior.

In uartlite where dynamic major number allocation is not present you get
correct behavior.
uartlite0 204/187
uartlite1 204/188
etc.

I didn't need to change anything in tty core because all of this is
possible to do. There was one patch in connection to reading aliases
which was properly reviewed and applied.
In general DT aliases behavior should be the same across all boards but
in reality it is not.

sure. This is the first time I hear about it. Based on my understanding
and current linux-next this patch is wrong. If there is any other series
please keep in me in CC and I will take a look at will test it on HW.

I didn't strictly follow this. Internally I have reviewed it but didn't
watch what exactly was merged to mainline.
