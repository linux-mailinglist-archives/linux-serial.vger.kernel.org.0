I agree in principle. Michal, since you have an @xilinx.com domain could 
you please share where that place to discuss is?

The Linux "devicetree" list doesn't not seem the right place either for 
a company-managed, separate repo. If this goes your suggested way 
(completely changing the uartlite driver to use the "serial" alias, the 
Xilinx DTG _needs_ to be improved, including respecting the serial0 
alias for the designated console. I'd be glad to contribute to the 
discussion there. Right not there's a mess that's not solved by throwing 
out the port-number property alone.

Big improvements are good and well, but they tend to break things and 
again it does mean the Xilinx DTG needs to move with that.
I'd be immensely grateful if you could indicate _where_ to discuss those 
changes, and who has the authority to speak for Xilinx. Off-list, if you 
think that is more appropriate.

Thank you,
Ruediger
