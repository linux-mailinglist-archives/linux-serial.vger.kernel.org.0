OK thanks for clarification.

I've should used also others like ttyTEST but result was same.

I'm writing a driver for the following model: Linux CPU is connected
with SPI with another CPU (Cortex M3) and this other CPU performs UART
handling based on data which comes over SPI. I would like to expose
Cortex M3 UARTS on linux as tty ports so it will act as standar serial
device.
