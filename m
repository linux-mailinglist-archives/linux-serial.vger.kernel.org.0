Ah, yes, I have to fix it locally. Thanks!

It hurts development a lot.

It _is_ the current state of affairs. Most of the contemporary drivers
do not support this "feature" at all.

Why do you need fractional baud rates for the small speeds? I do not
believe we have any good use case for that. And 1/2 from 134 is less
than 0.5% which is tolerable by UART by definition.

So, please no, drop it.

I do not object to this, but perhaps in the form of documentation it
would serve a better job (no-one will need to go deep into the Git
history for this, especially non-developer people who just got a
tarball, for example).

At least that table with divisors and deviation with accompanying
text. But I dare to say 90-95% of the commit message and leave
something like "Here is a new driver. documentation is there." To
where? Documentation/admin-guide seems most suitable right now
(looking at the presence of auxdisplay folder), however I think that
maybe dedicated folder like Documentation/hardware-notes maybe better.

+Cc: Mauro. What do you think about this? We need a folder where we
rather describe hardware features and maybe some driver implementation
details.

Lines of code in the current 8250_pci in conjunction with expansion.
To me 331 (okay, it's something like 280?) LOC + sounds like a very
good justification to split.

If you have a consensus with yourself :-) Maintaining 8250_pci is a burden.
You may look into the history of 8250_pci (and you will often see my
name there) how it was shrinking in time.

And my point is to calculate is always based on the asked baud rate.
Yes. I understand what you wrote above and sometimes only brute force
can be used, but in the kernel we have integer arithmetics which helps
a lot besides the fact of bits twiddlings.

It's possible that it doesn't fit in the current form or for all three
integers. Just give some time and think about it. Maybe you can come
up with a better idea. I usually point to one case I have solved [1]
to show that ugly tables can be dropped (in some cases it makes sense
to leave them, though).
