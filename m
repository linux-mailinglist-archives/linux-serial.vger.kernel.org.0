Well, I'd rather fix it, as serial console is otherwise very suitable
for my needs.

If nobody else interested, I'll simply disable the lock you've added
for non-smp builds
in my kernel version, rather than trying to fix the issue in general.

That said, finding generic solution would be an interesting quest.

What bothers me is "we have no real option..." part of this, as it's rarely
happens to be the case.

The oops part is already special-cased and could be left special-cased, one
way or another. What is important is not to keep interrupts disabled for long
during normal system operation.

If it could be achieved at all, it probably should then be implemented at the
upper level,  to save low-level drivers from these complexities.
