Looks like you didn't get any real feedback to your first two RFC
series, before you resent as non-RFC and it was merged without any
discussion. :/

Yeah, you definitely tried to get feedback on this.

Right, I had missed some of the back story.

Perhaps you should hold off on spreading this further until it can be
reviewed. Looks like it's mostly contained to xilinx_uartps right now.

Yep, you clearly tried to get feedback, but our process fails sometimes.

> If you know better way how this can be done, please let us know.

Having separate tty drivers and allocating a new major number for every
serial port clearly isn't the right way at least (and especially not for
fpga uarts of which there could be plenty).

If you can't implement what you're after with the current serial-core
and tty infrastructure, those subsystems may need to be updated first.

Yes, but not by papering over the problem.

Yeah, sorry, I was obviously looking at the wrong tree this morning.

As I mentioned above, only half of the uartlite series was merged, but
that was enough to break module unload.

Thanks for the pointer.
