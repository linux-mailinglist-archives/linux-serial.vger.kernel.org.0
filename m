I don't know that. What I see the test is as simple as
while (--count) which is basically > 0.

Any research article about it? What about wrong integral promotions which
I consider is a root cause of many bugs? People should learn that, or the
C (standard) should be fixed to make it easier to get.

Again, where this statistics comes from? Maybe it's a simple answer to the
question that review in kernel is not good enough?

Again, I don't see any proofs.

Your very patch suggests one of the solution to switch to unsigned to fix a
kernel bug (though with lowest severity).

Any code which was written in unthought manner is a buggy code. So, how
unsigned vs. signed loop counter any different here to any other buggy code?

See above. I think the root cause that people do not understand C and how to
program in C in bug-less manner.
