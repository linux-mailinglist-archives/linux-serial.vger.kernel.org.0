Had to go back to lore to see why I changed this:

	https://lore.kernel.org/all/20230604123505.4661-1-johan@kernel.org/

IIRC we had a user that was not expecting break signalling to only work
with one of the two ports of a Silabs device without user space being
notified about it.

In the cover letter I mention that the intent of "commit 9e98966c7bb9
("tty: rework break handling") from 2008 appears to be to allow missing
support to be reported to user space".

Reporting back an error also avoids waiting for the break period when a
subdriver does not support break (i.e. as when a tty driver does not
support break).

The inconsistency was discussed and if this turns out to be an issue we
can have the tty layer turn that -ENOTTY into 0 before returning:

	https://lore.kernel.org/all/ZH8a12ZYtA2RzEK_@hovoldconsulting.com/

I haven't heard from anyone noticing any issues so far though.

Johan
