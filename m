We have some PCIe attached UARTs that doesn't appear until after the
system is up and running (they sit behind an FPGA controlled from
userspace.) Some revisions have built-in UARTs while others don't, and I
would like to run the same kernel, rootfs, and boot configuration on all
of them.

Agreed. Although we have seen races between the DELETE and ADD uevents
mentioned below, leading to non-deterministical device numbers.

From a system booted with these patches, and 8250.nr_uarts=0, I get two
ports from ACPI PNP:

# cat /sys/class/tty/ttyS0/port
0x3F8
# cat /sys/class/tty/ttyS1/port
0x2F8

which matches the SERIAL_PORT_DNFS define in arch/x86/include/asm/serial.h

My endgoal is to avoid a bogus ttyS0, but a working driver (for the PCIe
connected ports).

I still think it seems wrong to have non-working device nodes. They only
confuse both people and software:

% sudo stty -F /dev/ttyS0
stty: /dev/ttyS0: Input/output error

Your interpretation of those two makes sense, but I don't really see a
usecase for setting 8250.nr_uarts at boot time though.
