OK. I did look at the mux-controller/mux-consumer bindings, but couldn't
really make heads or tails of it, and there aren't a whole lot of
examples in-tree. Also, the C API seems ... not quite what is needed
here. I realize that's not really anything to do with the best way to
describe the hardware, but that, plus the fact that the serial core
already handles a number of gpios controlling circuitry related to
rs485, was what made me go for one extra gpio.

How would a mux-consumer description look?

  mux-states = <&mux 0>, <&mux 1>;
  mux-state-names = "rs485", "rs232";

or should that be mux-controls? Would that be enough so that we're sure
that if and when a rs422 state is needed that could easily be
represented here?

Now implementation-wise, there's the complication that switching the mux
to/from rs485 mode must be done after/before the driver's ->rs485_config
is called, to avoid the transceiver temporarily being activated (thus
blocking/disturbing other traffic). That plus the need to mux_*_deselect
the old mode means the consumer (serial core in this case) ends up with
quite a lot of bookkeeping, and even more so taking error path into
consideration.
