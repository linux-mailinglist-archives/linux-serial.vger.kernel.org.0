Here I mean n_tty_receive_buf_common(). I will add a dump stack info in v5
like the following:
flush_to_ldisc() needs to wake up the relevant data handle thread. When 
executing __wake_up_common_lock, it calls spin_lock_irqsave(), which does
not disable preemption but disables migration in RT-Linux. This prevents
the kworker thread from being migrated to other cores by CPU's balancing
logic, resulting in long delays. The call trace is as follows:
    __wake_up_common_lock
    __wake_up
    ep_poll_callback
    __wake_up_common
    __wake_up_common_lock
    __wake_up
    n_tty_receive_buf_common
    n_tty_receive_buf2
    tty_ldisc_receive_buf
    tty_port_default_receive_buf
    flush_to_ldisc

OK. I may change it as the following:
Introduce flip_wq in tty_port which can be set by tty_port_link_wq() or as
default linked to default workqueue allocated when tty_register_driver().
The default workqueue is allocated with flag WQ_SYSFS, so that cpumask and
nice can be set dynamically. The execution timing of tty_port_link_wq() is
not clearly restricted. The newly added function tty_port_link_driver_wq()
checks whether the flip_wq of the tty_port has already been assigned when
linking the default tty_driver's workqueue to the port. After the user has
set a custom workqueue for a certain tty_port using tty_port_link_wq(), the
system will only use this custom workqueue, even if tty_driver does not
have %TTY_DRIVER_CUSTOM_WORKQUEUE flag.

OK. I may change it as the following:
Introduce TTY_DRIVER_CUSTOM_WORKQUEUE flag meaning not to create the
default single tty_driver workqueue. Two reasons why need to introduce the
TTY_DRIVER_CUSTOM_WORKQUEUE flag:
1. If the WQ_SYSFS parameter is enabled, workqueue_sysfs_register() will
fail when trying to create a workqueue with the same name. The pty is an
example of this; if both CONFIG_LEGACY_PTYS and CONFIG_UNIX98_PTYS are
enabled, the call to tty_register_driver() in unix98_pty_init() will fail.
2. Different tty ports may be used for different tasks, which may require
separate core binding control via workqueues. In this case, the workqueue
created by default in the tty driver is unnecessary. Enabling this flag
prevents the creation of this redundant workqueue.

After applying this patch, we can set the related UART tty flip buffer
workqueue by sysfs. We set the cpumask to CPU cores associated with the
IMU tasks, and set the nice to -20. Testing has shown significant
improvement in the previously described issue, with almost no stuttering
occurring anymore.

OK, it hasn't exceeded 100 characters, so I won't break it into a new line.

I overlooked the fact that tty_unregister_device performs the cdev_del
release action. I will move the alloc_workqueue before tty_cdev_add() like
the following:

	if (error < 0)
		goto err;

	if (!(driver->flags & TTY_DRIVER_CUSTOM_WORKQUEUE)) {
		driver->flip_wq = alloc_workqueue("%s-flip-wq", WQ_UNBOUND | WQ_SYSFS, 0, driver->name);
		if (!driver->flip_wq) {
			error = -ENOMEM;
			goto err;
		}
        ...
	}

	if (driver->flags & TTY_DRIVER_DYNAMIC_ALLOC) {
		error = tty_cdev_add(driver, dev, 0, driver->num);
		if (error)
			goto err_destroy_wq;
	}
    ...

err_unreg_devs:
	for (i--; i >= 0; i--)
		tty_unregister_device(driver, i);

	scoped_guard(mutex, &tty_mutex)
		list_del(&driver->tty_drivers);

err_destroy_wq:
	if (!(driver->flags & TTY_DRIVER_CUSTOM_WORKQUEUE))
		destroy_workqueue(driver->flip_wq);

It's my fault. I will change it as follows:
		for (i = 0; i < driver->num; i++) {
			if (driver->ports[i])
				tty_port_link_driver_wq(driver->ports[i], driver);
		}

I do not perform the tty_port_link_wq() in tty_register_device_attr(). I
execute tty_port_link_wq() in tty_register_driver().
In my previous version, I created the workqueue in tty_port_init, but
since tty_port_init is a void-return function, it cannot handle errors
related to workqueue allocation failure. So, I looked for other suitable
functions to handle workqueue allocation and found that both
tty_register_driver() and tty_register_device_attr() were potential
options. However, I realized that tty_port_register_device_attr_serdev()
may not call tty_register_device_attr, while every tty-related driver
would call tty_register_driver. Therefore, I decided to perform the
workqueue allocation in tty_register_driver.
I did not directly perform the tty_port_link_wq() action in
tty_port_link_device() because there are several usage scenarios that
follow this execution order:
    tty_alloc_driver()
    driver->name = xxx
    tty_port_link_device()
    tty_register_driver
In such cases, if I were to directly perform the tty_port_link_wq() action
in tty_port_link_device(), I would need to create the workqueue in
tty_alloc_driver, but at that point, the driver’s name is not yet known,
which prevents the creation of a workqueue with WQ_SYSFS. Therefore, for
this scenario, I can only perform the workqueue creation in
tty_register_driver before executing the link action.
Additionally, I have confirmed that every call to tty_port_link_device() in
the current kernel code is accompanied by a call to tty_register_driver().
The tty_port_link_device() interface is also used in tty_port.c, and I have
added the tty_port_link_driver_wq() call at every location where the
tty_port_link_device() interface is called.

OK, I will change it as follows:
/**

 * @port: tty_port of the device
 * @flip_wq: workqueue to queue flip buffer work on
 *

	port->buf.flip_wq = flip_wq;
}

Are you saying to prefix the macro with @? I see that in the current code,
they are also prefixed with %, as shown in the comments in the tty_driver.h
file below:
 *	If the driver sets %TTY_DRIVER_HARDWARE_BREAK in tty_alloc_driver(),
 *	then the interface will also be called with actual times and the
 *	hardware is expected to do the delay work itself. 0 and -1 are still
 *	used for on/off.
I'll change as following using () to mean function:
 * @TTY_DRIVER_CUSTOM_WORKQUEUE:
 *	Do not create workqueue when tty_register_driver(). In the case, you must
 *	set flip buffer workqueue by tty_port_link_wq() every port.

It is indeed confusing, I will add the description of tty_port_link_driver_wq()
in the commit log and before tty_port_link_driver_wq().
In the commit log:
...
nice can be set dynamically. The execution timing of tty_port_link_wq() is
not clearly restricted. The newly added function tty_port_link_driver_wq()
checks whether the flip_wq of the tty_port has already been assigned when
linking the default tty_driver's workqueue to the port. After the user has
set a custom workqueue for a certain tty_port using tty_port_link_wq(), the
system will only use this custom workqueue, even if tty_driver does not
have %TTY_DRIVER_CUSTOM_WORKQUEUE flag.
Before tty_port_link_driver_wq():
/*
 * Never overwrite the workqueue set by tty_port_link_wq().
 * No effect when TTY_DRIVER_CUSTOM_WORKQUEUE, as driver->flip_wq is NULL.
 */
static inline void tty_port_link_driver_wq(struct tty_port *port,
					   struct tty_driver *driver)

My thought is that even if the TTY_DRIVER_CUSTOM_WORKQUEUE flag is not set,
the user can still call tty_port_link_wq to link a specific tty port to a
custom workqueue, thus overriding the existing workqueue in the current
tty_port. Therefore, I cannot check for NULL in the tty_port_link_wq(), as
it must unconditionally set the workqueue.
