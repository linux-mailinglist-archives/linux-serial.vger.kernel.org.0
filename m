Hi Andy,

 Something wrong with your "From:" header; I've fixed it up based on a 
best guess basis.

 I have actually carefully considered it before submission and:

1. it remains a supported user API with a tool included with contemporary 
   distributions, and

2. with this device you can't set all the possible whole-number baud 
   rates let alone UART clock frequencies with the BOTHER API, and

3. it doesn't hurt.

If you'd like to get rid of SPD_CUST, then just do so, but until then I 
fail to see a point to have it supported with some devices but not other 
ones.

 NB if you do get to it, then please consider adding an equally flexible 
API too, e.g. for fractional baud rates (134.5bps haha); I won't mind if 
it's less hackish though.

 The relevant stuff has been included as comments along with actual code 
already, and the rest is the usual submission-time rationale.  This will 
be the initial source of information when someone studies the history of 
this code (`git log').

 I don't consider it cast in stone however, so if there's any particular 
piece you'd like to see elsewhere, then please point out to me what to 
move and where.  Or give any guidance other than just: "Rewrite it!"  

 (Yes I often have troubles figuring out the real intent of some changes 
made say 15 years ago that have turned out broken after all those years 
and whose change description is simply too terse now that the lore has 
been lost.)

 I have found it unclear where the line is drawn between having support 
code included with 8250_pci.c proper and having it split off to a separate 
file.  All the device-specific files seem to provide complex handling, 
well beyond just calculating the clock.

 I'll be happy to split it off however (with a suitable preparatory 
change) if there is a consensus in favour to doing so.

 Thanks for the pointer, I didn't know we had this piece.

 However how is it supposed to apply here?  The denominator is always 8,
so we can rule it out (by multiplying the dividend by 8, which this piece 
does, so that the divisor is a whole number), but the numerator has to be 
a product of three integers, from a different range each ([4,16], [8,511], 
[1, 65535]) as noted above.

 Essentially we need to find such three integers (with extra constraints) 
the product of which is closest to (500000000 / baud_rate) -- which IMHO 
amounts to factorisation, an NP-complete problem as you have been surely 
aware (and the whole world relies on), and I have decided that this simple 
table-driven approximation is good enough to handle the usual baud rates, 
especially the higher ones.  For several baud rates it gives more accurate 
results (lower deviation) than the factors proposed in the manufacturer's 
datasheets.

 I just fail to see how your proposed algorithm could be factored in here, 
but I'll be happy to be proved wrong, so I'll appreciate guidance.

 In any case thank you for your review, always appreciated!

  Maciej
