{sigh}

No, I don't want this.  My "goal" is to be able to get rid of all of the
crazy "PLAT_*" symbols as they make it impossible to build a single
kernel that supports multiple ARM64 systems.

As an example of just such a system, see the 5.4 tree here:
	https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common/+/refs/heads/android-5.4
it is now building and booting on multiple SoCs.

But yes, it still does have to enable some PLAT_* config options, but
the goal is to not have to do that eventually.

There is no reason that we need vendor-specific config options just to
lump random drivers into, like serial drivers.  If the hardware is not
present, the driver will just not bind to the hardware, and all is fine.

Just like x86, we don't have this issue there, and ARM64 should also not
have this.

Sorry for delay in writing this back to the original thread where you
objected to the original patch, it's still in my review queue along with
a ton of other serial patches.

thanks,
