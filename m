I'm not disputing using the console, it's the vt layer that I'm talking
about.  The DRM developers have the long-term goal of getting rid of
CONFIG_VT which will remove a ton of mess that we have overall.
DRM-based consoles should provide the same functionality that a vt
console does today.  If not, please let them know so that the remaining
corner cases can be resolved.

No, no need for x or wayland there from what I recall.

And there is not really any "fat" there, sorry, it's a way to give you
all of those glyph and input systems and functionality that you need.
That wasn't added for no good reason.

The drm console layer.

I don't know what fbterm is, sorry.

Ok, but we haven't seen the patches to know this :)

I agree, keeping the existing ones is key.  You are talking about
extending the existing ones in a way that adds additional complexity
when there might already be a solution for this for you.  That's why I
brought that up.

code formatting is NOT "inessential", please never think that.  Our
brains run on patterns and common code formatting allows us to see the
real issues here.  To not follow those formatting rules means we just
can't review your code properly.

Reviewing is harder than writing code, so you have to write the code to
make reviewing easier if you wish to have anything accepted as you have
to convince everyone else that your changes are correct.

Break down the changes into "one logical change per patch" to make them
easy to review.  It's an art form, think about how you want to get to
your end result and then take us on a path that is "obvious" to get
there over a series of changes.

Think of it as "showing your work" when solving a math or physics
problem that your teacher told you to follow.  No one wants to just see
the end result, they have to see all the steps along the way to even
begin to understand if the end result is correct or not.

But again, before doing that work, see how using the drm console works
for you, or not.  If not, let us and the drm developers know so that we
can work toward solving those issues, as that might actually be easier
to do.

thanks,
