Hmm, it seems that tree is mostly about the PowerPC era Macs; the only 
thing enabled for x86 there is MAC_EMUMOUSEBTN. There is also 
platform/x86/apple-gmux.c for an x86 Mac specific thing...

We already broke tradition with the "apple," DT compatible prefix (used 
to be AAPL for the PowerPC Macs), and these chips aren't even just used 
in Macs (e.g. the iPad, which in theory people would be able to run 
Linux on if someone figures out a jailbreak), so perhaps it's time for 
another break here?
