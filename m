Does a DRM based console exist at the moment?  I spent quite some time
looking for it yesterday, but found nothing.

Again, does it exist yet, or alternatively are there plans to introduce
it into the kernel in the near future?

It's a user level terminal emulator for the framebuffer.  It's not
important.

Where/how can I find the DRM console?

However necessary code formatting is (and it is necessary), it doesn't
form part of the essence of the changes.  I'm sure we're agreed that
proposed changes are best judged by that essence.  That was all I meant.

I understand.

Thanks.  I have a fair amount of work to do to achieve this.

I would actually appreciate the work I've done being superfluous.  ;-)
But where can I find the drm console?

And thank you, too.
