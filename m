I was basing this on Joe's discovery of the value used for 110 bd by the windows driver (confirmed by Charles). The sequence 80 01 a6 a8 implies that the mantissa is 0x6a8 (i.e. 11 bits). The tests that I did seemed to confirm this.

I quite agree. It would be cleaner.

Pardon my ignorance of the process but where is the git repo for this development branch?
