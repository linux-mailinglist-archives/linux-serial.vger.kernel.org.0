No, see paragraph 6 in the wall of text above. The CTSC/CTS is 
synchronous to the internal UART IP clock. The GPIO workaround has 
downsides due to switching lag which breaks various deployments. Here 
the GPIO is only used to keep the CTS line LOW on boot ; after the 
driver takes over, the driver controls the CTS line all the time.

Yes, I can add some abbreviated version of the commit message as a comment.
