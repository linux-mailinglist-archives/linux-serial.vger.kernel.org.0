Thanks Ilpo
    I can confirm that the patch below works. Got the WARN_ON_ONCE dump so it's taking that path.
I think the problem here is that the pl330 DMA controller thats in these SOC's doesn't "really" support pause according to the driver.
It doesn't look like it can ever set "DMA_PAUSED"
I'm not sure of the flow through of that though.
There is some commenting in the pl330 driver about the pause routine.
