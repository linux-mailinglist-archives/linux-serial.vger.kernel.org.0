 This description seems broken indeed and I find your interpretation of it
correct.  I do hope this is just an editorial mistake with the NXP device.

 FWIW I chased documentation for the original 16550A device and it uses 
analogous wording[1]:

"Bit 5: This bit is the Transmitter Holding Register Empty (THRE)
indicator. Bit 5 indicates that the UART is ready to
accept a new character for transmission. In addition, this bit
causes the UART to issue an interrupt to the CPU when the
Transmit Holding Register Empty Interrupt enable is set
high. The THRE bit is set to a logic 1 when a character is
transferred from the Transmitter Holding Register into the
Transmitter Shift Register. The bit is reset to logic 0 concur-
rently with the loading of the Transmitter Holding Register
by the CPU. In the FIFO mode this bit is set when the XMIT
FIFO is empty; it is cleared when at least 1 byte is written to
the XMIT FIFO."

It further documents polled operation for THRE[2]:

"LSR5 will indicate when the XMIT FIFO is empty."

and provides further details as to the transmit FIFO[3]:

"The NS16550A transmitter optimizes the CPU/UART data
transaction via the following features:

"1. The depth of the Transmitter (Tx) FIFO ensures that as
    many as 16 characters can be transferred when the
    CPU services the Tx interrupt. Once again, this effec-
    tively buffers the CPU transfer rate from the serial data
    rate.

"2. The Transmitter (Tx) FIFO is similar in structure to
    FIFOs the user may have previously set up in RAM. The
    Tx depth allows the CPU to load 16 characters each
    time it switches context to the service routine. This re-
    duces the impact of the CPU time lost in context switch-
    ing.

"3. Since a time lag in servicing an asynchronous transmit-
    ter usually has no penalty, CPU latency time is of no
    concern to transmitter operation."

This design choice may result in "choppy" transmission due to the transmit 
handler invocation latency, but as noted above it is intentional.  DMA can 
be used with the NS16550A if it is required to avoid this issue, and later 
compatible UART designs such as the 650 give more flexibility as to the Tx 
FIFO fill level trigger threshold.
