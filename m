I meant switching to using one-byte words so that we end up with a
16-byte FIFO where we don't have the issue of adding more data when the
last word is not a full four-byte one.

Right. But with a 16 1-byte word FIFO, we may be able to kick of a
really long transfer and just keep it running until it needs to be
kicked again (cf. enabling TX). The console code can easily insert
characters in the FIFO while the transfer is running (and would only
have to wait for 16 characters to drain in the worst case).

Effectively, most of the identified issues would just go away, as
there's basically never any need to cancel anything except at port
shutdown.

I didn't do an in-depth analysis of the slowdown, but I did rerun the
tests now and I'm still seeing a 22-24% slowdown on x1e80100 with rc5.
This is a new platform so I compared with sc8280xp, which shows similar
numbers even if it's slightly faster to begin with:

					sc8280xp	x1e80100

	rc5 full series			61 s		67 s
	rc5 last patch reverted		50 s		54 s

I have a getty running and cat a 10x dmesg file of 543950 bytes to
/dev/ttyMSM0 from an ssh session (just catting in a serial console gives
similar numbers).
