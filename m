That's what we do on some other architectures to emulate the non-posted
behavior of out[bwl], as required by PCI. I can't think of any reasons to
have a barrier before in[bwl], or after write[bwl], but we generally want
one after out[bwl]

My preference would be to have whatever makes most sense in theory
and also fixes the problem. If there is some documentation that
says you need a certain amount of time between accesses regardless
of the barriers, then that is fine. I do wonder if there is anything
enforcing the "rpcc" in _delay() to come after the store if there is no
barrier between the two, otherwise the delay method still seems
unreliable.

The barrier after the store at least makes sense to me based on
the theory, both with and without a delay in outb_p().
