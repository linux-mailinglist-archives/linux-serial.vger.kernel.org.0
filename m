 That was back in 2020 (5.9.0), so long before be140f1732b5, and it's a 
production system, so I don't want to fiddle with it beyond necessity:

$ uptime
 16:53:27 up 466 days,  9:49,  5 users,  load average: 0.14, 0.12, 0.09
$ 

 Essentially defxx has this code (not changed much since, except that 
`dfx_use_mmio' is now always true for PCI):

	if (!dfx_use_mmio)
		region = request_region(bar_start[0], bar_len[0],
					bdev->driver->name);
	if (!region) {
		dfx_register_res_err(print_name, dfx_use_mmio,
				     bar_start[0], bar_len[0]);
		err = -EBUSY;
		goto err_out_disable;
	}
	/* ... */
	if (dfx_use_mmio) {
		/* ... */
	} else {
		bp->base.port = bar_start[0];
		dev->base_addr = bar_start[0];
	}

so whatever came out of BAR[1]:

pci 0031:02:04.0: [1011:000f] type 00 class 0x020200
pci 0031:02:04.0: reg 0x10: [mem 0x620c080020000-0x620c08002007f]
pci 0031:02:04.0: reg 0x14: [io  0x0000-0x007f]
pci 0031:02:04.0: reg 0x18: [mem 0x620c080030000-0x620c08003ffff]
pci 0031:02:04.0: BAR0 [mem size 0x00000080]: requesting alignment to 0x10000

was supplied to `inl'/`outl' and wreaked havoc.

 First of all I think `request_region', etc. ought to fail in the first 
place with non-port-I/O systems: why does a request for a resource that 
cannot be satisfied succeed?  It would have already solved the issue with 
defxx, making the driver gracefully fail to register the device.  I don't 
know if this has been fixed since.

 Second, rather than relying on a magic mapping in the physical space 
causing a bus error (unless you are absolutely sure it is going to work in 
100% cases), I think it would make sense to make port I/O accessors call 
BUG_ON(no_port_io) explicitly for platforms where it is only known at run 
time whether PCI/e port I/O is available or not.  Port I/O is the opposite 
of performance already, so a couple of extra instructions will be lost in 
the latency and at least POWER has conditional traps, so there'd be no 
branch penalty.

 I would expect serial ports to be the most common PCIe options still 
using port I/O.  Sadly OxSemi was acquired and their line of devices, 
which support MMIO, cancelled at one point and my observations seem to 
indicate that what is still manufactured uses port I/O (correct me if I'm 
wrong please).  Last time I checked OxSemi-based option cards were still 
available though, but one may have to check with the supplier as to 
whether they have been configured for MMIO or port I/O, as they're not 
dual-mapped.

 I think serial port options are the most likely devices still in use, 
given that UARTs continue being widely used in industrial applications.  
Depending on application a USB serial adapter may or may not be suitable 
to interface those.

 Thanks for letting me know.  Is it AArch64 only that has no port I/O 
support in the PCIe root complex nowadays, or is it 32-bit ARM as well?
