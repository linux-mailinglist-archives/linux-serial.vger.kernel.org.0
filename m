The original commit has been merged so quickly after being posted
that people had no time to review/NAK it properly:

Also I have no idea why Krzysztof has posted his "Reviewed-by:" tag
for the original commit.

No, they don't. Geert has explained this to you twice (however
for some reason you seem to keep on ignoring this).

Also on ARM64 there is no PLAT_SAMSUNG defined at all!

In case of PLAT_SAMSUNG usage in SERIAL_SAMSUNG dependencies
it is just a shortcut for saying:

	depends on ARCH_S3C24XX || ARCH_S3C64XX || ARCH_S5PV210 || \
		   ARCH_EXYNOS || COMPILE_TEST

and we can just use ARCH_* dependencies as well (PLAT_SAMSUNG
is used only because it is shorter).

ARCH_* dependencies on ARM platforms are used to describe SoC
families and are in no conflict of supporting multi-platforms
images (somer SoC families don't support such images but for
other reasons).

On ARM64 building the single kernel that supports multiple ARM64
systems is the default and all Samsung SoCs are included in such
image (as only some Samsung Exynos SoCs are 64-bit capable only
ARCH_EXYNOS is relevant on ARM64).

Also ARM multi-platform support is similar to other archs (like
mips or powerpc).

On x86 we have BIOS, ACPI and other forms of hardware abstractions
that we don't have on ARM64.

Please also note that we have things like "depends on X86_32" or
"depends on ACPI" also on x86.

Like described above: PLAT_SAMSUNG is just a way to share the common
architecture code between different Samsung SoCs families inside
arch/arm/*:

arch/arm/plat-samsung/Kconfig:

...
config PLAT_SAMSUNG
	bool
	depends on PLAT_S3C24XX || ARCH_S3C64XX || ARCH_EXYNOS || ARCH_S5PV210
	default y
	select GENERIC_IRQ_CHIP
	select NO_IOPORT_MAP
	help
	  Base platform code for all Samsung SoC based systems
...

while PLAT_S3C24XX comes from arch/arm/mach-s3c24xx/Kconfig:

...
if ARCH_S3C24XX

config PLAT_S3C24XX
	def_bool y
	select GPIOLIB
	select NO_IOPORT_MAP
	select S3C_DEV_NAND
	select IRQ_DOMAIN
	select COMMON_CLK
	help
	  Base platform code for any Samsung S3C24XX device
...

We can use ARCH_* symbols for device drivers dependencies directly,
PLAT_SAMSUNG is used only because it is shorter.

We don't expect Samsung Serial hardware to start appearing on non
ARM/Samsung SoCs any day soon (if ever).

Currently your changes make i.e. x86_64 configs to ask about its support,
(people doing "make oldconfig" on linux-next are seeing it).

Yes, we have passed that problem with the usage of COMPILE_TEST config
option and your change defeats its whole purpose.

I've asked you in the original commit mail thread whether you are
planning to remove COMPILE_TEST and you seem to avoid answering my
question.
