Hi Thomas,

I would like to go back to this discussion :)
From what I could understand, and read back the thread:

- The spurious detector is used to avoid cpu hog when a lots of IRQs are 
  hitting a cpu, but few ( < 100 / 100k) are being handled. It works by
  disabling that interruption.

- The bug I am dealing with (on serial8250), happens to fit exactly at
  above case: lots of requests, but few are handled.
  The reason: threaded handler, many requests, and they are dealt with in 
  batch: multiple requests are handled at once, but a single IRQ_HANDLED 
  returned.

- My proposed solution: Find a way of accounting the requests handled.

  - Implementation: add an option for drivers voluntarily report how 
    many requests they handled. Current drivers need no change.

  - Limitation: If this issue is found on another driver, we need to 
    implement accounting there as well. This may only happen on drivers
    which handle over 1k requests at once.


What was left for me TODO:
Think on a generic solution for this issue, to avoid dealing with that 
in a per-driver basis. 

That's what I was able to think about:

- Only the driver code knows how many requests it handled, so without  
  touching them we can't know how many requests were properly handled.

- I could try thinking a different solution, which involves changing only
  the spurious detector.

  - For that I would need to find a particular characteristic we would want 
    to avoid spurious detection against, and make sure it won't miss an
    actual case we want to be protected about.

Generic solutions(?) proposed:
- Zero irqs_unhandled if threaded & handles a single request in 100k
  - Problem: A regular issue with the interruption would not be detected 
    in the driver. 

- Skip detection if threaded & the handling thread is running
  - Problem 1: the thread may run shortly and batch handle a lot of stuff, 
  not being detected by the spurious detector. 
  - Problem 2: the thread may get stuck, not handle the IRQs and also not
  being detected by the spurious handler. (IIUC)


In the end, I could not find a proper way of telling apart
a - "this is a real spurious IRQ behavior, which needs to be disabled", and 
b - "this is just a handler that batch-handles it's requests",
without touching the drivers' code.

Do you have any suggestion on how to do that?

Thanks!
Leo
