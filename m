Hmm... But do I understand correctly the following:

- the IRQ core knows the amount of generated IRQs for the device (so it's kinda
obvious that IRQ number maps to the driver);

- the IRQ core disables IRQ while handling an IRQ number in question;

- the driver is supposed to handle all IRQs that were reported at the beginning
o.f its handler;

- taking the above the amount of handled IRQs is what came till the disabling
IRQ. IRQs that came after should be replayed when IRQ gets enabled.

?
