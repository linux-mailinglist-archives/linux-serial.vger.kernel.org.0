Hello,

Matthias Reichl, le mer. 04 nov. 2020 15:57:37 +0100, a ecrit:

This looks like only a warning, did it actually crash?

It is fatal for module insertion yes (EINVAL) but IIRC that should be
getting handled properly, making modprobe return the error?

spk_ttyio_initialise_ldisc only has a dev_t so can't do much beyond
calling tty_kopen.

tty_kopen is getting the index from the tty_lookup_driver call (actually
get_tty_driver which uses p->minor_start and p->num) and passes it to
tty_driver_lookup_tty. Perhaps in addition of p->num the driver should
have another field to set, that tty_init_dev could use to reject with
ENODEV indexes beyond what the driver actually provides?

That's probably because in the ttyUSB case the device allocation is
dynamic and made exactly according to the number of actual devices,
while for ttyS* there is a large overcommit of minor values.
