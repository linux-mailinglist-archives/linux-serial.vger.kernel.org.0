So some program in the boot sequence is trying to send data out the
device?  Why not just not do that?

Wait, you said something in the boot process did write to the device,
which would have caused the tty to be opened then, right?

Where are the characters coming from that would need to be flushed?
When should characters be flushed exactly?
