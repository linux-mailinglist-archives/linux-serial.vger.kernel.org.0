I admit my ignorance - but I've always been told that the behaviour
of always unconditionally asserting both DTR & RTS on serial port open
is mandated by both POSIX and SUS, which is why all Unix-style OSes
have been following this behaviour up until 2021-04, when FreeBSD 13.0
became the world's first Unix-style OS to provide an *option* for
users to opt out (on a per-serial-device basis) of this standards-
mandated behaviour.

In my own use case, it is only USB: my hw device is one where a
USB-serial chip (FT2232D in my case) and the circuit that repurposes
DTR & RTS outputs from one of the UARTs (FT2232D Channel B in my case)
are inseparably integrated on the same PCB, with a custom USB VID:PID
identifying the device as a whole.  However, I have been told that in
order to be acceptable into Linux mainline, the proposed solution has
to work for all similarly affected parties and not just my device,
hence I am also considering a "generic" case where a custom hw device
would have an old-fashioned RS-232 electrical interface and could be
connected to "any" serial port.

I can make this change in the next version of my patch series, once I
get a clarification from Greg as to the correct way to denote the
chain of authorship and revision.
