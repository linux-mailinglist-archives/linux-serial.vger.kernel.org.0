This is also already supported in mainline.

Devices with sync_state() implementations (once Ulf adds it) will have
a state_synced file in sysfs. It shows where it has been called yet or
not. But you can also echo 1 into it to force the sync_state()
callback (only if it hasn't been called already). So, yeah, all
methods of handling this are available if you implement the
sync_state() callback.

By default it's all strict (wait till all consumers probe
successfully). But you can set it to timeout (fw_devlink.sync_state).
And you also have the option I mentioned above that you can use with
both cases.
