That noticed is enforced by our exchange server. I have removed it by

Original message is copied below.

Hi,

I'm not sure if this is the right place for this, but hopefully someone 
can help me figure out what else I can do to troubleshoot this problem, or 
point me to the right place to ask questions about this.

A recent investigation led us to discover issues related to the RS485 
IOCTLs on our serial cards utilizing the 16C950 UART. More specifically, 
the TIOCSRS485 IOCTL to set the serial_rs485 flags as documented at 
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/serial/serial-rs485.html 
.

When attempting to set the SER_RS485_ENABLED flag using TIOCSRS485 as per 
below I receive an error code 25, "Inappropriate IOCTL for device"

	/* -----RS485----- */
	struct serial_rs485 rs485conf = {0};
	rs485conf.flags |= SER_RS485_ENABLED;
	rc = ioctl(fd, TIOCSRS485, &rs485conf);
	if (rc < 0) {
        	printf("error=%d %s\n", errno, strerror(errno));
		return rc;
	}

From what I've read this typically indicates an unsupported serial device, 
but the documentation mentions the 16C950 UART as a specific example, so I 
would think the kernel is intended to support this functionality on the 
16C950. 
 
I have tried this across several kernel versions: 3.10 (Centos 7) , 4.18 
(Centos 8), and 5.11 (Ubuntu 21.04) with no change in the behavior. 
The issue was originally discovered on a PLX OXPCIe952 UART, but has been 
replicated on 'standard' OX16C950 UARTs as well. setserial -ag correctly 
identifies all cards as 16950's (Specifically "16950/954").

Has anyone else had or seen this IOCTL issue on the 16C950? Are there any 
'known good' 16C950 based cards people can confirm that this works with?

Let me know if you need any more details/testing. I also tried to 
configure my email client to behave nicely with the mailing list. Does it 
seem ok?

P.S, I also tried using 3rd party libraries that support the RS485 flags, 
such as 
https://pyserial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyserial_api.html#rs485-support, 
in case there was something broken in my C application, but I get the same 
error.
