Subject: [PATCH 00/26] tty: drop low-latency workarounds
Date:   Wed, 21 Apr 2021 11:54:43 +0200
Message-Id: <20210421095509.3024-1-johan@kernel.org>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.26.3
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-serial.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-serial@vger.kernel.org

The infamous low_latency behaviour of tty_flip_buffer_push(), which
meant that data could be pushed to the line discipline immediately
instead of being deferred to a work queue, was finally removed in 2014.

Since then there's no need for drivers to keep hacks to temporarily drop
the port lock during receive processing but this pattern has been
reproduced in later added drivers nonetheless.

Note that several of these workarounds were added by a series posted in
2013, which ended up being merged despite having completely nonsensical
commit messages. As it turned out, it was just the RT patch set which
effectively enabled the low_latency flag for serial drivers that did not
handle it.

There's of course nothing wrong releasing the port lock before calling
tty_flip_buffer_push(), and some drivers still do after this series, but
let's get rid of the completely unnecessary unlock-and-reacquire
pattern.
