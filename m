What exactly breaks?  The new option is enabled by default, just like
the one right beside it (SERIAL_8250_PNP), so nothing at all changes
unless this is actively disabled.  On a system that doesn't have those
ports, any attempt to access the device nodes produces some kind of
error.  How is it breaking anything to not create device nodes for
hardware that doesn't exist?
