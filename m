Hi Andy,

I guess it's a toss up between is the attribute more ugly than #ifdefs
and is the ugliness of either worth it..
Not going to say I have an answer here. :)

That's true but the linker on my machine with 64GB of RAM compiling
for a single core machine with 64MB of RAM doesn't mind too much.

I looked into making OF ids smaller globally. There seems to be 64
bytes wasted from the start for the name and type fields as nothing
uses them as far as I can tell.
Then you have the array for the compatible string which is currently
128 bytes but the longest compatible string in the kernel is less than
64 from what I can tell.
I understand that it's for future proofing etc. Adding a few hacks to
my kernel to remove the unused fields and reduce the size of the
compatible string saved a few tens of K.
Which isn't a lot but might be the difference between the kernel
fitting in a tiny SPI NOR partition or not.

Ok.. I might consider pushing my changes to remove unused ids all over
the place then.
drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq-dt-platdev.c is a really good example of
adding ~10K to kernels for no reason.

I have a minimal config but compiling in macb for the ethernet
compiles in code and ids for stuff like zynq that I could do without.

It's not *that* bad just yet. :)

Anyhow, thankyou for the interesting discussion. I'll just leave this
in my tree for now so I don't have to see the warning.

Cheers,

Daniel
