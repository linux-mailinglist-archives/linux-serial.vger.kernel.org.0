As I told you back in May, registering one uart driver per physical
port is precisely what should not be done. Just register a fixed number
of lines like every other tty driver. And if you're worried about
statically allocated memory, you need to address that in the tty layer
and/or serial core instead of hacking every single uart driver to
pieces.

Specifically, you could move the uart state allocation to port
registration so that all drivers would benefit from this.

This is already causing way more trouble than it's worth, and the big
number you mention above for pl011 is 14! In comparison, usb-serial
currently supports 512 ports just fine by allocating state at
registration.  

Greg, I reread some of the mails reachable through the above link and
was reminded that this hack also made it into xilinx_uartps. That would
need to be fixed/reverted as well.
