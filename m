It's pity we are discussing this off-list.
Cc linux-serial@ now and leaving original writings as is.

The use of clk_set_rate_exclusive()/clk_rate_exclusive_put() seems better.
But, while from our (Intel) perspective this looks like no-op, for others,
especially zillions of ARM boards using DesignWare UART it might be crucial.

I would suggest to Cc new version to some ARM people (homework: filter
MAINTAINERS along with `git log -- drivers/tty/serial/8250/8520_dw.c`
to see who may have relation to this driver).

Yes, and AFAIU the last person in a chain submits the work.

So, it should reflect how patch went thru people's trees. If you send from your
tree, where patches are created originally, there shouldn't be other SoBs (use
suitable Reviewed-by, etc). At least this is safest side. However, better to
ask maintainer (Greg KH in this case) and other senior developers.
