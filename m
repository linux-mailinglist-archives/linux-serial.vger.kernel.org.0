Forced threaded interrupts have so far run with interrupts enabled and
spin_lock_irqsave() would suffice on non-RT. This is about to change
though so that drivers don't need to worry about "threadirqs":

No, no. RT handles this by deferring console writes apparently.

Again, no. It's even been a requirement due to "threadirqs" in some
cases (e.g. hrtimers) up until now (or rather until the above patch is
in mainline).
