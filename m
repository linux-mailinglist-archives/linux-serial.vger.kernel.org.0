That's correct.

Sure. Any time there is more than 1 source of truth, they could be
mismatched. But it is 1 spec and 1 schema to compare, not N DTS files.
Checking the schema matches the spec is much easier than reviewing
every new DTS file.

The only true fix is to make the spec machine readable.

That moves validation from build time to run time. How is that better?
And what about other OSs?

I'm very much of the opinion that it is not the kernel's job to
validate the DT. It obviously has not done a very good job given
issues we find with schemas. It's fine to have some checks in this
case if the kernel can't function (or use/enable the extension)
without the dependent extensions, but there are lots of classes of
errors the kernel doesn't need to care about.

Personally, if I was going to do validation with code, I would pick
python or any language that can handle lists and dicts natively. I too
would prefer C for everything, but it's not the best tool for the job
here. Even if we decided to do validation in C (I'm pretty sure we had
a proposal to do just that at some point), we'd just end up defining
our own data structures of validation data. Because at the end of the
day, most of the validation information is all the same structure of
data (i.e. a list of properties with lists of allowed values). I'd
much rather follow some standard (json-schema) that's already
documented than try to come up with my own poorly documented
invention.

I do think there is some need for code based validation as there are
some things which can't be expressed with schemas. We have some of
that in dtc, but that only works for core bindings. Some sort of
python snippets of code in schemas is kind of what I'm thinking.

Probably so.
