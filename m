In general uart_startup() is called before set_termios() ,but as per the 
crash logs shared, it seems RX engine is active(which can only happen 
from set_termios) before startup() is called.

We cannot adjust handle_rx() to check for a NULL fifo pointer as reading 
from RX FIFO is mandatory to clear the sticky bit set.  We are passing 
"true" to handle_rx function so it will read and discard whatever data 
present in RX FIFO, it won't send to upper layers. We are planning to 
post a patch which has rx_fifo buffer allocated in probe itself, in 
order to avoid the NULL dereference.
