While that is true, there are many such controllers around.

Yes, but we don't need that. As discussed, the UART driver can cope with
edge IRQs just fine.

True. Interrupts cannot be shared for this device then. That's a fair
limitation, and it has always been like that.

It's a controller that sits behind another hardware bus itself, so
polling is expensive. If the controller would need to check for level
IRQs it would need to poll, and then we could as well just poll the UART
directly, that's just as good :)

But again - the UART driver works perfectly fine with edge IRQs as long
as the interrupt is not shared.

There can be flags in the 2nd cell of the node, but their meaning is
specific to the controller. Hence the SPI/I2C layers don't pass that
information up.

What many drivers do is try with one setting, and if that fails because
the interrupt controller returns an error, they fall back to something
else. We could do the same here of course, but it'd be another patch on
top, as it's unrelated to the concrete change the patch we're commenting
on is bringing in.

So what I can add is logic that first tries with IRQF_LOW|IRQF_SHARED,
and if that fails, we fall back to IRQF_FALLING and retry. WDYT?



Thanks,
Daniel
