Thanks, I apparently didn't do "--strict" checking, sorry. Will fix both in PATCH v3

As I point out in the other thread
  "[PATCH v2] uartlite: Update the default for the SERIAL_UARTLITE_NR_UARTS"
(I don't feel crossposting all of it here would be good practice)

a) the Xilinx DTG gives "serial" aliases to _all_ Xilinx UARTs
b) the Xilinx DTG gives "port-number" properties to _all_ Xilinx UARTs
c) these two are not assigned in the same order by the Xilinx DTG, which is problematic

uartlite.c currently looks at port-number properties, not aliases. So unassigned aliases are not the 
issue. A similar-looking but more complicated issue that COULD happen, to be transparent, is this:

* I have 1 ps_uart ("psuart1") and 2 uartlites ("uartlite0" and "uartlite1")
* The second uartlite is configured in MSS to be the OS console_device
* SERIAL_UARTLITE_NR_UARTS = 2
* The current Xilinx DTG could assign like this:
   uartlite1: port-number=<0> (because console)
   psuart1:   port-number=<1>
   uartlite0: port-number=<2>

* uartlite0 gets probed first, gets reassigned line 0, uartlite1 is probed, gets reassigned line 1, 
which means it's not the console

Except MSS seems to list uartps after uartlite, so even that does not happen. So yeah, this 
convoluted scenario could only be fixed by a much bigger change (see your next point below and my 
reply) OR by fixing the Xilinx DTG. "serial" alias order as currently generated by the Xilinx DTG is 
also a bit of a mess, as I explain in the other thread.

Right now it seems xilinx_uartps.c is only using
   id = of_alias_get_id(pdev->dev.of_node, "serial");
and then checking
   if (id >= CDNS_UART_NR_PORTS) {

Which means it's relying on
a) CDNS_UART_NR_PORTS being high enough and
b) the Xilinx DTG giving ps_uarts preferential treatment (i.e. always starting alias enumeration 
from serial0 with ps_uarts first).
I can envision in principle changing uartlite.c to the mechanism you suggest but it is a much bigger 
change, with the potential to break more stuff.

This is currently a minimal fix to the issue of the DTG not being compatible with the proper use of 
SERIAL_UARTLITE_NR_UARTS; it won't even be required anymore if Xilinx accepts my DTG patch. As the 
current DTG does not evenly hold "serial" aliases and "port-numbers" the same, I really don't see 
why they should not.

Thank you,
Ruediger
