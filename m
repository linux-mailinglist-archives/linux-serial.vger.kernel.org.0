This is implementation detail in Linux, but in HW why are those not a proper
PCI endpoints / functions? With that done, the drivers can be just normal
PCI device drivers.

Yes, so it's rather something with a custom FW that is not supposed to be
changed (at least from the device hierarchy / functionality perspective),
or very little from version to version. Is this a correct summary?
