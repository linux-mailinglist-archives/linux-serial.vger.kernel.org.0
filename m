Unlikely in production datacentre/cloud environments, indeed, although 
some of the mid-range kit like LX2160 does start to blur the line of 
what might be considered "server", and that's one example which *does* 
have full-featured DT support (even if it also aspires to ACPI...)

What I thought was worth clarifying for the general audience is that the 
relevant aspects of "server" here should in fact still be possible to 
reproduce on something like a Raspberry Pi or a tiny QEMU VM, if one can 
figure out the ACPI runes :)

Thanks,
Robin.
