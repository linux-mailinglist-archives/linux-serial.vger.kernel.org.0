As the LITEX config symbol above uses plain "bool", without a
description, it is invisible.  Hence it cannot be enabled by the user,
only be selected by other symbols.
If LITEX_SOC_CONTROLLER is the only symbol selecting LITEX, the
dependency is met.

With the spinlock and the loop, they're too large to be inlined, IMHO.

Good.

(assuming 32-bit physical reg accesses below)

Sure, 64-bit register accesses consist of two 32-bit accesses on other
32-bit platforms, too.

Is this due to the CSR bus or due to the CSR register?
I mean can two 64-bit accesses to different CSR registers be done as
four interleaved 32-bit accesses, or must they not be interleaved?

If (hopefully) they can be interleaved, you just need serialization of
accesses to the same 64-bit register.  As the same register is usually
not accessed from multiple drivers, you can handle the serialization
inside the driver, if it can ever happen at all (e.g. main driver
operation and interrupt handler accessing the same register).
That avoids the need for the spinlock in the generic register accessors.

If they must not be interleaved, you indeed need serialization at the
bus level, but only for the 64-bit accesses?  And I would strongly
suggest to look into changing the CSR bus behavior at the hardware
level, if possible...

Sure. Been there, done that ;-)
