-Serial Slave Device DT binding
-
-This documents the binding structure and common properties for serial
-attached devices. Common examples include Bluetooth, WiFi, NFC and GPS
-devices.
-
-Serial attached devices shall be a child node of the host UART device the
-slave device is attached to. It is expected that the attached device is
-the only child node of the UART device. The slave device node name shall
-reflect the generic type of device for the node.
-
-Required Properties:
-
-- compatible 	: A string reflecting the vendor and specific device the node
-		  represents.
-
-Optional Properties:
-
-- max-speed	: The maximum baud rate the device operates at. This should
-		  only be present if the maximum is less than the slave device
-		  can support. For example, a particular board has some signal
-		  quality issue or the host processor can't support higher
-		  baud rates.
-- current-speed	: The current baud rate the device operates at. This should
-		  only be present in case a driver has no chance to know
-		  the baud rate of the slave device.
-		  Examples:
-		    * device supports auto-baud
-		    * the rate is setup by a bootloader and there is no
-		      way to reset the device
-		    * device baud rate is configured by its firmware but
-		      there is no way to request the actual settings
-
-Example:
-
-serial@1234 {
-	compatible = "ns16550a";
-	interrupts = <1>;
-
-	bluetooth {
-		compatible = "brcm,bcm43341-bt";
-		interrupt-parent = <&gpio>;
-		interrupts = <10>;
-	};
