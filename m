struct uart_port contains a cached copy of the Modem Control signals.
It is used to skip register writes in uart_update_mctrl() if the new
signal state equals the old signal state.  It also avoids a register
read to obtain the current state of output signals.

When a uart_port is registered, uart_configure_port() changes signal
state but neglects to keep the cached copy in sync.  That may cause
a subsequent register write to be incorrectly skipped.  Fix it before
it trips somebody up.

This behavior has been present ever since the serial core was introduced
in 2002:
https://git.kernel.org/history/history/c/33c0d1b0c3eb

So far it was never an issue because the cached copy is initialized to 0
by kzalloc() and when uart_configure_port() is executed, at most DTR has
been set by uart_set_options() or sunsu_console_setup().  Therefore,
a stable designation seems unnecessary.
