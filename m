Boy, it's been _ages_ since I looked at anything to do with dwc2, but
I still have some fondness in my heart for the crufty old driver :-P I
know I was involved with some of the patches to get
wakeup-from-suspend working on dwc2 host controllers in the past but,
if I remember correctly, I mostly shepherded / fixed patches from
Rockchip. Not sure I can spend the days trawling through the driver
and testing things with printk that really answering properly would
need, but let's see...

My genpd knowledge is probably not as good as it should be. Don't tell
anyone (aside from all the people and lists CCed here). ;-)

...so I guess you're relying on the fact that
dev_pm_genpd_add_notifier() will return an error if a power-domain
wasn't specified for dwc2 in the device tree, then you ignore that
error and your callback will never happen. You assume that the power
domain isn't specified then the dwc2 registers will be saved?

I guess one thing is that I'd wonder if that's really reliable. Maybe
some dwc2 controllers lose their registers over system suspend but
_don't_ specify a power domain? Maybe the USB controller just gets its
power yanked as part of system suspend. Maybe that's why the functions
for saving / restoring registers are already there? It looks like
there are ways for various platforms to specify that registers are
lost in some cases...

...but I guess you can't use the existing ways to say that registers
are lost because you're trying to be dynamic. You're saying that your
registers get saved _unless_ the power domain gets turned off, right?
...and the device core keeps power domains on for suspended devices if
they are wakeup sources, which makes sense.

So with that, your patch sounds like a plausible way to do it. I guess
one other way to do it would be some sort of "canary" approach. You
could _always_ save registers and then, at resume time, you could
detect if some "canary" register had reset to its power-on default. If
you see this then you can assume power was lost and re-init all the
registers. This could be pretty much any register that you know won't
be its power on default. In some ways a "canary" approach is uglier
but it also might be more reliable across more configurations?

I guess those would be my main thoughts on the topic. Is that roughly
the feedback you were looking for?
