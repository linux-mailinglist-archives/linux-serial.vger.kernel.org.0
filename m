I mainly meant the time when the driver is initialized, when moving from 
univ8250 -> the actual 8250 driver for the particular HW. It's one of the 
points of interest.

I don't know if the tracing side has something more "standard" for this 
already and since you're looking to that already, it's good to take 
notice if there's something.

Some drivers for 8250 variants have such registers. Not that they're 
common so it's perhaps not a big deal.

I wonder why you have to rely on that. Why e.g. ktime_get_boottime() is 
not enough for this usecase?

I still find it hard to believe you could not keep track of it all 
without strlen(), snprintf() returns the number of chars it wrote to 
uart_debug->line so it should be that length - uart_debug->offset?

I don't know if there's a rule. But having had to parse those :: inputs 
way too many times in the past, I have very little love for that format 
being forced on user ;-).

Ah, I see.

~/linux/uart/drivers/tty/serial/8250$ git grep 'private_data =' | wc -l
20

There are multiple 8250 variant drivers using it.

Some also come with additional registers so it's all relevant also in 
serial/8250/ domain.
