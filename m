I modified pericom_do_startup to log when the UPF_MAGIC_MULTIPLIER flag 
was present. Then tried to set the port to 3000000 a few times. The port
stayed at 9600. It looks like pericom_do_startup() is getting called 
twice per port on boot, and the flag is gone with the second one.

[    4.925577] [J4D] flag present
[    4.926121] [J4D[ flag not present
[    4.926843] [J4D] flag present
[    4.927415] [J4D[ flag not present
[    4.928106] [J4D] flag present
[    4.928673] [J4D[ flag not present
[    4.929419] [J4D] flag present
[    4.930447] [J4D[ flag not present

[   49.528504] [J4D[ flag not present
[   51.675240] [J4D[ flag not present
[   59.617954] [J4D[ flag not present

Then I modified it to log when it was adding the flag in. The port was 
set to 3000000. Also the flag only needed to be added in once. It sticks 
after the first time.

[    4.647546] [J4D] flag present
[    4.648119] [J4D] flag not present(adding)

[    4.651192] [J4D] flag present
[    4.651718] [J4D] flag not present(adding)

[   96.025668] [J4D] flag present
[  100.130626] [J4D] flag present
[  116.435436] [J4D] flag present

I mostly just guessed at do_startup() being the place to set the magic 
multiplier flag after it didn't stick in quirk in 8250_pci.c.
