I was motivated to make the tracing as unobtrusive as possible and it seemed
like the rdtsc instruction would be very fast and very precise.  I'll have to
profile ktime_get_boottime() to see how much overhead that adds.

True.  I could store the total string length and trade a little more memory and
a little more complexity for a little less CPU time.  Do you think it's a good
tradeoff?  The strlen() call should be pretty fast since the string is a maximum
of 27 characters.  Also, this is in the trace consumer path where performance
is not as important as the trace producer path.

OK, I've changed the format from "hh:mm:ss:mmmuuu" to "ssssssss:mmmuuu".

OK, I've added a new field named 'debug_data' and I'll use that instead of
'private_data'.  My latest changes are in the v3 patch.
