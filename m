How is set_termios involved? Is that starting the RX side before
uart_startup() is called? Sorry I haven't looked into the code flow very
deeply here.

It seems to happen when the bluetooth driver probes so maybe constantly
adding and removing the hci_uart module will cause this to happen for
you? I also run the kernel with many debug options enabled, so maybe try
enabling all the debug stuff? I see it randomly right now so I'm not
sure.

Ok. If we have to read the rx fifo to flush the buffer then perhaps
write another function that qcom_geni_serial_stop_rx() can use to
indicate that it wants to throw away whatever is in the rx fifo? Or
adjust handle_rx() to check for a NULL fifo pointer and throw it away in
that case? When we're setting up this device I don't understand why we
would want to read anything out of the rx fifo that was there before the
driver started.
