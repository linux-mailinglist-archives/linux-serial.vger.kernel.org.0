To me this looks now more an attempt to repurpose the nr_uarts to mean 
something it really hasn't. Clearly it hasn't meant non-discoverable 
ports earlier but something related to the maximum number ports. This also 
explains why we had that misunderstanding about the meaning of nr_uarts 
between us earlier.

The code which makes this "wrong behavior" to happen is the last loop in 
serial8250_find_match_or_unused(). Given its comment, I think it has been 
very much intentional behavior. Pretending that non-discoverable port is 
more real/precious than a port that was later _discovered_ and is very 
much a real one is what brings you to this renumbering issue.

I'm not anymore sure about your goals really. Now it sounds one of the 
goals is preserving the non-discoverable ports, whereas previously it was 
just about allowing 0 of them.

How about you add entirely new CONFIG and/or param for this minimum number 
of non-discoverable ports and make the last resort loop (or perhaps all 
but the first loop) in serial8250_find_match_or_unused() to honor that 
(start looking only from port above that index). If it defaults to 0, I 
think this renumbering issue is avoided. Would it work for all the goals 
you have? 

With that change, I don't know what condition should trigger what you do 
in 3/4 though.
