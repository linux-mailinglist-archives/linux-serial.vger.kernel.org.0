Sorry, I somehow thought it's obvious when in fact it appears it isn't.

When user calls ioctl() to set/clear TIOCM_RTS bit from user space, the
RTS/CTS automatic handshake must not be affected. Without this patch
setting TIOCM_RTS to logic 0 turns off RTS/CTS handshake in hardware,
and setting it to logic 1 turns on RTS/CTS handshake in hardware, that
is wrong thing to do in both cases.

I'm sure the patch is the right thing to do here (see below for more
discussion). Just stop fiddling with RTS/CTS handshake bit in
set_mctrl(), and it will work as expected.

Worse. In fact it breaks current UCR2_CTSC state on both branches of the
if, and thus breaks correspondence between CRTSCTS and UCR2_CTSC that
the driver should preserve at all times.

Once again, that's exactly why we need to stop touching UCR2_CTSC in
set_mctrl().

It's not a problem at all. When user wants to drive RTS manually, he
turns off RTS/CTS handshake. When RTS/CTS handshake is turned on,
setting/clearing TIOCM_RTS usually has no effect on the level of the RTS
pin.

This is still wrong, as it turns off RTS/CTS handshake in hardware on
TIOCM_RTS=0. Once again, set_mctrl() should not touch UCR2_CTSC, -- it's
as simple as that.

I still think it's rather what I did in the patch above is the right
thing to do. It's simple and does the job, no surprises.
