They'd generate a warning, which can then be fixed. That's fine to do, a
warning in linux-next doesn't harm anyone. Updating devicetrees in ways
that don't change their meaning but provide extra value is not a problem
in my book.

That was my first question after all! Ultimately I'd really err on the
side of adding it because people will expect to be able to use it and
because, in terms of kernel support, it will be useful for ACPI systems.
