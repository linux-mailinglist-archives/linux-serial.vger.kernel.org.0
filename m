That is correct, serdev can not handle break conditions on the tty port
right now.  You need to write a "real" serial driver if you want to have
that type of control over the connection.

You could propose a patch for serdev to handle break, try that and
submit it and see if the serdev maintainer agrees that it is a worth
addition.
