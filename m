Hi John,

Thank you for the comprehensive feedback. Some replies below.

In general, agreed. But there are some quirks and peculiarities in how
the issue (increased audio latency) manifests itself on R-Car3, which
might create some room for a (relatively simple) loophole solution in
the printk mechanism.

With that said, I need to diverge a bit from the platform-agnostic
scope of this series.

So, what's specific to R-Car3, based on my testing, is that the issue
can only be reproduced if the printk storm originates on CPU0 (it does
not matter if from interrupt or task context, both have been tested). If
the printk storm is initiated on any other CPU (there are 7 secondary
ones on R-Car H3), there is no regression in the audio quality/latency.

I cannot fully explain this empirical observation, but it directs my
mind to the following workaround, for which I have a PoC:
 - employ vprintk_safe() any time CPU0 is the owner/caller of printk
 - tie CPU0-private printk internal IRQ workers to another CPU

The above makes sure nothing is printed to the serial console on behalf
of CPU0. I don't even hope this to be accepted by community, but can you
please share your opinion the idea itself is sane?

This confirms the internally established view on the issue.

It's helpful to have your feedback on this.

I didn't dive into the internals of this series, but decoupling the
execution context of the serial driver from the execution context of
the printk callers sounds very good to me (this is what i try to achieve
via vanilla vprintk_safe). I wonder if it's easier to remove CPU0 from
equation with this series applied.

That's an extremely useful feedback. However, I still see non-trivial
differences between mainline and linux-rt-devel:

$ git diff --shortstat v5.4.13..v5.4.13-rt7
  401 files changed, 9577 insertions(+), 3616 deletions(-)

I would be happy to see this slimming down over time. If there is any
roadmap publicly available, I would appreciate a reference.
