Please always cc: the developer who wrote a commit that you have
questions about, so that they are sure to see it, otherwise it's just
random luck :)

It seems like this change does the opposite of what it says, we don't
want the device to wait for a full endpoint of packets to send stuff
out, right?

If you revert this commit on top of the latest kernel release, does it
solve the problem for you?
