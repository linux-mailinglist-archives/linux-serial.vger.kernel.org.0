Is this per device settings requierement valid also for a new line
discipline module or is it acceptable if a new "module level settable"
linee discipline module has also a global behaviour (as current one)
?If per tty device setting is requiered pointers/doc on possible
exemples/mecanismes to achieve this are welcome.

You're right, I initialy thought that ldattach support would be
requiered
(
https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux/blob/master/sys-utils/ldattach.c
as for the drivers list) but after first tests on a separate module,
it's still possible to use ldattach as is with the new line discipine
index. Only support for using the module name as argument is
requierement which is not blocking.

I have been working a little on this already, was waiting for list
comments/answers to proceed further.
Is there a prefered name as the module is mostly a clone of the pps-
ldisc current one one with first patch changes ? I went for ppsex-ldisc 
for now.
Is it Ok to share & modify the C structures of pps-ldisc (especially
tty_ldisc_ops as per initially proposed patch) or should a full new set
also be added ?
