No, it's console_write() which can end up being called in hard irq
context and if that path takes the port lock after the now threaded
interrupt handler has been preempted you have a deadlock.

You don't end up in s3c64xx_serial_handle_irq() here. It's just that
console_write() (typically) takes the port lock which is already held by
the preempted s3c24xx_serial_tx_irq().
