 Hmm, this is probably the least horrible way to paper it over, thanks.  
Even using a temporary variable (let alone a cast) does not help as GCC 
sees through it, and I've given up on converting <linux/serial_reg.h> to 
have e.g.:

#define UART_MCR_CLKSEL		_UL(0x80) /* Divide clock by 4 (TI16C752, EFR[4]=1) */

as I find that too messy with many of the comments wrapping up.  And using 
a GCC pragma would require a messy compiler version check.

 I have posted an update with a path-of-least-resistance fix then along 
with the 4/4 as v2 of this series.
