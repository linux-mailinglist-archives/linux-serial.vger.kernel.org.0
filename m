... and likely difficult to implement, since the spinlock is there to
prevent coincident usage from userspace and kernel space to the port.
If userspace is outputting a message in unison with a kernel console
message, there must be exclusivity, otherwise the two messages will
either be intermingled, or completely corrupted due to TX FIFO
overflow, making the console quite useless.

Higher latency is something that IMHO has to be accepted as a result
of using serial console.

As Jiri says, the way around that is to use as fast a baud rate as
possible on the serial console.
