The nature of the upstreaming process will require what you have to be
broken down into multiple parts and be upstreamed at different times,
depending on how long components take to review. This is normal and
expected. Of course there should be through testing done, but I don't
think that what is in this initial patchset really requires much
testing - if it boots then it's probably sufficiently tested!

If there's ever going to be complete upstream support for your device,
then there will be two versions, because looking at just the dts files
in the gitee sdk you linked I have noticed things that are not acceptable
in upstream. As others have said, you are not entitled to control the
upstreaming process for your device. The only way to have some control is
to submit patches yourself and to engage with the review process for other
components. It's in everybody's interest to keep differences with your
SDK to a minimum, but you need to accept that there will always be
differences because the upstream community simply has higher standards
than those in your SDK as well as a requirement for portable code that
you do not have.

It's only better if Anlogic submits better quality patches (no evidence
for that yet) or submits the patches more promptly than others (which
clearly has not happened here), and offers review commentary etc at a
higher standard and more frequently than a non-employee maintainer would
be able to do (there's no evidence for that so far either, given you're
trying to stall this patchset). Your claim seems to have no merit as
there is no proof that you'd do a better job.

Thanks,
Conor.
