OK. If the patch did not apply against v6.5, can you please verify you don't
have other patches applied like your revert? I don't think the patch I sent
is white space damanged or anything. Doing git diff v6.5.. should show you
what might be different :)

Not sure what you mean with the 8250 entries from before loading the
patched driver..

Maybe things go wrong already somewhere earlier if the integrated 8250
port(s) don't show up either? If so, maybe this issue is somehow machine
specific rather than 8250_exar specific.

Can you please post or email me your full working dmesg output, failing
dmesg output, the kernel .config used, and kernel command line?

Also, do you have any suggestions for a commonly available pcie 8250_exar
card I could try to reproduce this issue with?

Regards,

Tony
