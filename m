The generic Alpha kernel has CONFIG_PCI=y, so the quirk is not applied,
both with and without the present patch.

You should be able to trigger the lockup that the quirk seeks to avoid
by closing the tty of either of the serial ports.  E.g., if you're using
the serial console, "cat" something to the other serial port's tty.
That will clear TIOCM_OUT2 in serial8250_do_shutdown() and should thus
provoke the lockup.  Alternatively, compile and run the little program
below on the Jensen.  (Pass a serial port tty as argument.)

Should you not be able to reproduce the lockup, then the quirk wouldn't
be necessary anymore and could be removed.

Thanks!
