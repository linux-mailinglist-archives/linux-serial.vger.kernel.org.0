The situation where the problem was noticed is: The 8313 is supposed to
periodically receive a burst of a small (and fixed) number of
characters. In the field it sometimes happend that there was a peak on
the data line between two such telegrams which the UART interpreted as a
character with a parity error. After that the first character of the
next telegram wasn't received in userspace, because the driver claimed
it was received with another parity error. So effectively a dropped
character.

I think I did. I have to plan a bit of continous time to reverify.

Not explicitly, but it does

	orig_lsr =3D up->port.serial_in(&up->port, UART_LSR);
	...
	up->lsr_saved_flags =3D orig_lsr;

So whatever error bit is read on function entry is reused for the first
char in the next irq run.

Yeah, I already looked into these and part of my plan to fix the
workaround was to bring fsl8250_handle_irq() on par with the generic irq
handler routine. Effectively there isn't missing much.

Will discuss that with my customer how much effort to put into this.
