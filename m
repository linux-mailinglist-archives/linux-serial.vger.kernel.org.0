No, as the sampling rate in sdm845 is 32, we will not be requesting 51.2 
over there.

Okay.

If i understand correctly, clk_round_rate gives the nearest possible 
value to the desired clk rate, but i am not very clear about 
divider_round_rate API, is it an alternate method to get nearest clk 
rate? Also it has few parameters like prate, clk_hw etc which we are not 
sure of. For now we are planning to post the change for clk_round_rate 
API.

okay will look into this.
