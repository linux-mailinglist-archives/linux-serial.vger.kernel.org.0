OK good point.

If a serial console is attached, we now have runtime PM usage count
always kept. Users can detach the console via sysfs as needed. See these
two earlier commits from Andy:

a3cb39d258ef ("serial: core: Allow detach and attach serial device for console")
bedb404e91bb ("serial: 8250_port: Don't use power management for kernel console")

Sounds like there's a bug somewhere. It's worth verifying if the runtime
PM usage count is kept for 8250_omap on suspend.

Thomas, care to check your test case with the attached debug hack
and by adding a call for pm_runtime_get_usage_count() on the suspend
path?

Regards,

Tony
