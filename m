You are listing two different things being done in this single commit.

It should be 2 different patches.

I would recommend getting more comfortable with Linux kernel development
by working in the drivers/staging/ portion of the kernel first.  And not
in the "core" kernel like tty/serial or other well-entrenched
subsystems.  That way you can learn the proper processes and workflows
better in an area of the kernel that is specifically designed just for
that, and not end up bothering the time of other kernel developers for
basic process issues like your recent patches have shown.

thanks,
