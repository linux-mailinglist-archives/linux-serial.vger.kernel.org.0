I've updated the patch to check for

  mctrl_gpio_to_gpiod(up->gpios, UART_GPIO_RTS)

as well as user-requested delays that exceed the fixed hardware delays.
The driver falls back to software emulation in that case.

Updated patch is on this development branch and is currently being
compile-tested by Intel's 0-day bot:

Thanks,
