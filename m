The clk_round_rate() API is to tell a consumer what rate they'll get on
a clk if they call clk_set_rate() with the same arguments that they pass
to clk_round_rate(). If this driver implemented a clk provider for
itself then it could hook into the clk_set_rate() and clk_round_rate()
logic and turn whatever 'desired_clk' it is that's passed in into the
rate rounding code that is implemented here.

The idea is that instead of hard coding the frequency table in this
driver, this driver implements a clk_hw for itself. Then that clk_hw
clk_ops implementation asks the parent clk (i.e. the one this driver is
currently clk_get()ing during probe) what frequency it can support if it
uses 'desired_clk * 2' or 'desired_clk * 3', up to how ever many divider
possibilities this uart hardware has. Then when the clk_op
implementation figures out the best rate that the gcc clk can provide it
tells the CCF that the parent rate will be prate =3D desired_clk * N and
then uses N as the divider that this driver controls.

This way everything is generic and we don't have to copy/paste tables
from one place to another. Does it make sense?

Whoa this looks familiar! :)
