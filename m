Subject: [PATCH v3 0/3] Add support for DEVNAME:0.0 style hardware based addressing

Hi all,

With the recent serial core changes, we can now add DEVNAME:0.0 style
addressing for the serial ports. When using DEVNAME:0.0 naming, we don't
need to care which ttyS instance number is allocated depending on HSUART
settings or if the devicetree has added aliases for all the ports.

This also allows us to also drop the old console_setup() parsing for
character device names.

Regards,

Tony

Changes since v2:

- Console name got constified and already applied as suggested by Ilpo
  and Andy

- Add printk/conopt.c to save console command line options

- Add a patch to drop old console_setup() character device name parsing

- Use cleanup.h to simplify freeing as suggested by Andy

- Use types.h instead of kernel.h as suggested by Andy

- Use strcspn() as suggested by Andy

- Various coding improvments suggested by Andy

Changes since v1:

- Constify printk add_preferred_console() as suggested by Jiri

- Use proper kernel command line helpers for parsing console as
  suggested by Jiri

- Update description for HSUART based on Andy's comments

- Standardize on DEVNAME:0.0 style naming as suggested by Andy

- Added missing put_device() calls paired with device_find_child()
