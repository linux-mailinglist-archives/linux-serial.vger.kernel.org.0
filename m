I can confirm that reverting 7a637784d517 makes the issue more difficult to
reproduce, and even when it is reproduced the amount of chars lost is
decreased. Enabling HW flow control is not trivial to test.

The uart is configured as 115200 8n1, 86usec per char, given the 25
chars FIFO is 2.150msec to service the irq and get the data out of the
fifo.

Just thinking at the MHz the CPU is 792MHz, however it can (and will)
scale down to 198MHz.

I would say that something like that should be reasonable to handle, but
it's just my gut feeling ...
