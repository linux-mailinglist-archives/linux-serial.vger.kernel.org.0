Yes but this shouldn't be an issue with this patchset. So far the
smallest DT-describale USB entities are the interfaces.

Additional support needs to be added if there are devices which need a
more fine-grained description. I can't implement this since I don't have
access to such devices. That beeing said, my patchset doesn't break such
devices because in that case these devices simply can't be described as
serdev device within the DT and the ttyUSBx devices are exposed to
userspace.

If one wants to add the support for it, the support can surely be added
afterwards too in a backward compatible manner.

Can you please elaborate how I can check this? I'm not aware of any
warning yet, but I only tested the hot-(un)plug. If I got your right, I
should see the issue once I unload the serdev driver, right?

Maybe it needs some adaptions but:

| The purpose of serdev is to provide kernel drivers for particular serial
| device, serdev-ttyport is no exception here. Make use of the
| tty_kopen_exclusive() funciton to mark this tty device as kernel
| internal device.

the last sentence should address your point that serdev ports can't be
shared with user-space.

Which new flag? As I have written in my commit message: "Make use of ...
to mark this tty device as kernel internal device". I thought this was
the purpose of tty_kopen_exclusive().
