Yes, it is clearly leaking extra flags (if those are set) both in the case 
of break workaround and without it.

C code is not "some black box". On the next irq, only BI in 
lsr_saved_flags is looked at by the driver, that can be seen from the C 
code, no need to look at the errata.

And then the C code also tells on the next next irq, the other bits (if 
any were set) are taken into use for a real character, which is 
undesirable (= BUG!).

Indeed, fixing a bug alters behavior such that the bug no longer occurs :-).

Or are you saying that leaking old FE, PE and OE into the next char 
using lsr_saved_flags when no break nor workaround isn't in the play
is an event that should _not_ be altered???

If no extra flags are set, the proposed change is no-op.

Maybe Uwe's fix could be scoped down to clear only FE, PE and OE if one 
really wants to make a minimal fix? That would leave (mainly) DR out of it 
which could impact the behavior a little (the difference seems a bit 
theoretic to me but it is there)?
