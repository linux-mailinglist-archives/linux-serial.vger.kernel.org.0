Thanks for the comments.

Yes. On BE-M1000 SoC Linux has no direct control over (most) clocks.
The registers of CMU (clock management unit) are accessible only from
the secure world, therefore clocks are managed by the firmware (ARM-TF).
Linux' driver is a shim which calls into the firmware. And that
4705882 Hz is exactly what is returned by firmware.

Got it.

What is the correct way to check if the rate returned by clk_round_rate
makes sense for the (new) baud rate? See, clk_round_rate is supposed to
give a supported rate which is closest to the requested one. Usually it
appears to be "close enough" to the requested rate (or an error), however
(as far as I understand) there is no a formal requirement (and it's up
to the driver to decide how close is "close enough").

Or should we just hope that the clock provider does the right thing?

Best regards,
   Alexey
