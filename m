Both of them are not the correct error to return when an ioctl is not
supported.

Please submit this change when you submit your driver that uses it at
the same time so we can review them all at once.  We do not add apis
that are not used in the kernel tree.

For tty devices, "custom" ioctls are not ok, use the standard tty
commands and you should be fine for everything you need to do.

If not, then perhaps your design is incorrect?
