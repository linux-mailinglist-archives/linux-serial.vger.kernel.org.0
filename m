Subject: [PATCH v3 0/6] serial: Disable DMA and PM on kernel console
Date:   Mon, 17 Feb 2020 13:40:10 +0200

This is third version to get rid of problematic DMA and PM calls in
the serial kernel console code.

Patches 1, 3 and 4 are preparatory ones.

After previous discussion Tony suggested to add a possibility to detach
and attach back kernel console from user space. It's done in the patch 2.

Kernel console is sensitive to any kind of complex work needed to print
out anything on it. One such case is emergency print during Oops.

More details on topic are in the commit messages of the patches 5 and 6.

The series has been tested on few Intel platforms.

Note, it depends to recently submitted and applied patches in
the core console code [2, 3]. Petr, may you confirm that [3] is
immutable or even send Greg KH a PR?

Greg, see above note before applying, thanks!
