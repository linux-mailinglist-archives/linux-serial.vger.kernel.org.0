Hi Breno,

Can you say which SoC in particular that is? Knowing that would help to
identify whether there's some known erratum, clocking issue, etc.

Likewise that might imply more folk to add to Cc.

Looking at the commit message, that was an issue with the a "custom
(non-PrimeCell) implementation of the SBSA UART" present on QDF400. I
assume that was soemthing that Qualcomm Datacenter Technologies designed
themselves.

It's possible that your SoC has a similar issue with whatever IP block
is being used as the UART, but the issue in that commit certainly
doesn't apply to most PL011 / SBSA-UART implementations.

If you have the same issue, then applying the same workaround makes
sense. As above, it's not clear that this is necessarily the same issue.
Any more detail that you can share regarding the SoC would be very
helpful.

Mark.
