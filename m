Ah, that's a good call. Right now it doesn't really happen since
people tend to hook up the debug UART without flow control lines (as
far as I've seen), but it's good to make sure it works.

Yeah, that's fair. I've responded to your patch with a
counter-proposal to fix the hard lockup regression, but I agree that
should take priority.

I'll respond more in dept to your patches, but I suspect that your
patch series won't fix the issues that N=C3=ADcolas reported [1]. I also
tested and your patch series doesn't fix the kdb issue talked about in
my patch #8. Part of my reworking of stuff also changed the way that
the console and the polling commands worked since they were pretty
broken. Your series doesn't touch them.

We'll probably need something in-between taking advantage of some of
the stuff you figured out with "cancel" but also doing a bigger rework
than you did.
