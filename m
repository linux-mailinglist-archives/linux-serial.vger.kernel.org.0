I managed to hit the vacation period before I was able to post the
series. I will pick it up this week and hopefully should be able to
post something next week.

For genpd, the plan is to check the initial state of the PM domain. It
can be powered-on or powered-off and if it's powered-on, we should not
allow it to be powered-off until after ->sync_state() have been
called.

The similar approach is what Saravanna is trying to implement for
clocks, I think.

In the end, we simply need to try out these approaches to see if they
really work. Although, based on previous discussions (LKML +
F2F-conferences), I think there should be a good chance for us.

[...]

Kind regards
Uffe
