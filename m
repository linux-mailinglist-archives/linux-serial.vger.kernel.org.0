Yeah, you may refactor it, but please mention in the comment (the text going
after '---' line) that you are not able to test it. At least for maintainer it
may be a crucial point either to take your change or not.

I guess it's an answer to the (1). Though in (1) I simple meant the removal
of blank line (see, I emphasized the excerpt I'm commenting with blank lines
before and after).

Yes, it needs to be in a separated (preparatory) patch.

I do mind, sorry. The rule of thumb is one logical change per patch.

It's not an excuse to put hacks in the code that will make maintenance hard.
The usual case is such situations is that author of the fix do:

- provide a fix (perhaps ugly one)
- refactor and clean up the code

So at the result we have keep maintainable piece in kernel.
This is by the way my main motivation to NAK this change.

Then it's no go for this patch, sorry.
