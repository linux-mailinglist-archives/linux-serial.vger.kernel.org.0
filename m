The easiest solution would be when all patches go via one tree.

Greg, would you want to take the 7 patches from
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/pmladek/printk.git/log/?h=for-5.7-console-exit
via your tree?

I have never done such shuffles between two maintainer trees.
Are there any preferred steps how to do so smoothly, please?

Best Regards,
Petr
