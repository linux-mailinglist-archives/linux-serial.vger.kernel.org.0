To give some contexts, I proposed to switch to kmscon for Fedora 44, so 
once we are there, it will be feasible to switch off VT, in 1 or 2 
years. But the requirement to rebuild the kernel, makes it painful to 
test, and much harder to get accepted.

Agreed, I can also keep this patch as downstream, if you think it's 
better that way. But I though it may interest other distributions as well.

I hope it won't get longer than 1 or 2 year.
