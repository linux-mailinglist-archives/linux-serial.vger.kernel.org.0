Yes, that is as-intended, why are you trying to break existing
functionality that has been present for forever?

It might be confusing, but it is correct.  You have to justify changing
existing functionality a lot, especially for user-visable stuff like
this.

And to say it is a "security issue" is not correct, it is this way by
design, please work to understand history before attempting to change it
for no documented reason.  Did you read the config option that helps
control this functionality?  Did the help text there not explain it
properly?  If so, please provide additional documentation where needed.

I suggest working with others at your company that have more experience
before submitting changes like this in the future, as they should be
able to help you out better instead of relying on the community to do
so.

thanks,
