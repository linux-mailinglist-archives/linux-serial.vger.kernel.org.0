Ok, this is ridiculous.

You are dropping a whole new subsystem on us, with full documentation,
correct driver model integration, crazy debugfs interactions (I made fun
of the patch, but the code did work, you just did more work than was
needed), proper auto-loading of modules, tracing, documentation for more
things than is ever expected, and now you are adding error injection
support?

You just made all other code submissions of new subsystems I have gotten
in the past 2 months look like total crud.  Which, to be fair, they
probably were, but wow, you just stepped up the level of professionalism
to a whole new height.

I can only dream that "real Linux companies" take note and try to follow
this example.  I think I will point them all at this in the future and
say, "go do it like this one."

very very very nice work, we owe you the beverage of your choice.
