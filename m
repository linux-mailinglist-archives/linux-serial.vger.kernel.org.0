Hi
    We seem to be getting corruption of received data from a ublox GPS unit
To me it looks like a fifo overrun of some sort??

background:
I'm attempting to use 6.3.3 as a new base for one of our systems.
Previously it was using 5.1.7 as a base.
The uart in question is one of the two in the Cyclone V SOC HPS.
And to muddy the waters the linux console TTYS0 is the other Uart from 
the same HPS core
Yet the console appears to be working ok.
Note all other libs and apps are at the same revision and build, it is 
only the kernel that is different.
Both versions of the kernel are also built using the same bitbake bsdk..

Seeing the following with 6.3.3:

But should be seeing this as shown on 5.1.7:
Excuse the offset (due to this frame also showing the packet id's and 
lengths)
But the body of the frame is what we should be seeing.

As you can see it looks like the frame thats received on the 6.3.3 
kernel is mangled?
This same message is just being requested over and over again from the 
GPS unit.

The offset where the tears occur looks to be pretty similar between each 
poll request.
Usually the 1 at the end of the (75331 is where the first tear occurs.

I'd appreciate some quidance in how to track this down as there appears 
to have been a reasonable amount of work done to this driver and the 
serial core between these two versions.

Cheers
    Richard Tresidder
