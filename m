8250 allows to set only divisor and the final baudrate which hw use is:

  baudrate = clock / (16*divisor)

In most cases base UART clock is fixed, so you can set only baudrates
for divisors 1, 2, 3, ..., N.

Kernel uses UART timeout value (stored in port->timeout variable) for
e.g. testing if TX fifo is empty. And uart_update_timeout() function
calculates this timeout from baudrate. Hence this change fixes UART
timeout.

As I wrote in above test, CBAUD Bnnn flag (in my test case B115200) was
still set. So userspace is not going to be broken. Kernel functions in
drivers/tty/tty_baudrate.c reports back to userspace original baudrate
value if is in 2% tolerance.

So, in case userspace ask for baudrate value which is not possible to
set (with 2% tolerance) then kernel would report in CBAUD flag different
value. But in this case UART transfer does not work as 2-3% is the
threshold when transmitter and receiver are de-synced and are not able
correctly receive any byte.

So with this change, userspace is notified in case kernel was not able
to set baudrate value which userspace asked and can report to user
reason why UART transfer does not work.

All above was about CBAUD flag, as this is the only supported kernel
flag by glibc.

Extended ioctl(TCGETS2) provides additional field c_ospeed, for which
glibc does not have API yet. This field is supposed to report current
real baudrate value, not rounded to nearest Bnnn value.

And more serial drivers already reports it. So if you set baudrate
115200 then more serial drivers in c_ospeed report real value (e.g.
114890). This is very useful for userspace as it can decide if the
current baudrate value is suitable for its limits. E.g. you may
construct UART receiver which would be able to detect data even if they
are only in 5% tolerance. So you set baudrate on transmitter and then
check if value set by kernel to hw is in tolerance or not.

> That feels very dangerous.  Why does this matter?

Current problem with this driver is that if userspace ask for baudrate B
and for value B there is no divisor D, then this drivers sets some
nearest divisor D' to hw. But divisor D' drivers different baudrate and
userspace did not receive any information that asked B is not possible
to set.

So, I do not think that this is dangerous. It just starts reporting
correct value via TCGETS2 API, like some other serial drivers are
already doing.

I wrote it in commit message. I constructed inverse of function
serial8250_get_divisor() which calculated divisor for UART HW, which is
what configures baudrate.
