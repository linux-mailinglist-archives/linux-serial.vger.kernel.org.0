It wasn't but now that I took a further look into it I've managed to 
prove myself that there are no changes at all in the _interactions with 
the device_ so Paul's concerns on making subtle changes are not valid!
The reason is as follows:

1) If BI is not set in lsr_saved_flags, the old lsr_saved_flags is 
recalled no earlier than in serial8250_read_char() at the point where the 
code is already past the only serial_in() there.

2) If BI is set in lsr_saved_flags, fsl8250_handle_irq() first clears BI 
and returns due to the workaround. On the next next irq, the old 
lsr_saved_flags is again not recalled before past the only serial_in() 
serial8250_read_char().

3) If execution does not even enter serial8250_read_char(), the old 
lsr_saved_flags value is not used at all and lsr_saved_flags is 
overwritten.

serial8250_read_char() only does bookkeeping and higher-layer stuff with 
the bits from lsr_saved_flags which does not impact how the kernel 
interacts with the device!
