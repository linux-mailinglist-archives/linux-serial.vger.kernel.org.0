An easier way to trigger this old bug is to just run a command like
dmesg and hit ctrl-s in a serial console to stop tx. Interrupting the
command or hitting ctrl-q to restart tx then triggers the soft lockup.

So I spent the better part of the weekend looking at this driver and
this is one of the bits I worry about with your approach as relying on
draining anything won't work with hardware flow control.

Cancelling commands can result stalled TX in a number of ways and
there's still at least one that you don't handle. If you end up with
data in in the FIFO, the watermark interrupt may never fire when you try
to restart tx.

I'm leaning towards fixing the immediate hard lockup regression
separately and then we can address the older bugs and rework driver
without having to rush things.

I've prepared a minimal three patch series which fixes most of the
discussed issues (hard and soft lockup and garbage characters) and that
should be backportable as well.

Currently, the diffstat is just:

	 drivers/tty/serial/qcom_geni_serial.c | 36 +++++++++++++++++++++++++-----------
	 1 file changed, 25 insertions(+), 11 deletions(-)

Fixing the hard lockup 6.10-rc1 regression is just a single line.
