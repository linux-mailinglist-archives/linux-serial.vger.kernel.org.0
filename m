When the Transmit Holding Register is empty, the Transmitter can still 
be
transmitting. And the Driver Enable must be held active during 
transmission.
I would even say it needs to held active during transmission of the stop 
bit,
but I don't believe there is any uart that has an interrupt flag for 
that.
And since the default state for RS485 is '1' anyway it's not that bad.
