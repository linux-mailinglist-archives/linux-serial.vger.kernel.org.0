Sorry for the delay. I managed to test it today. My test file contained
70 lines of "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog". I used upto
1200 Baudrate to send the text from the desktop using the Exar serial I
have and I did not notice any message loss on the receiving laptop.
Please let me know if you want me to test further.
