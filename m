You might want to start in the drivers/staging/ part of the kernel to
get your bearings and work out these types of things.  It's "easier"
there as the code there needs lots of work and it's set up to handle new
developers like yourself.

the output of the git command that caused those lines to be written was
taken from the subject lines of the patches in your tree.  Yet the
subject lines of the patches you emailed us did not match that at all,
so what you sent is not what you actually had here when you generated
that cover letter.  So something went wrong with your process.

Try deleting all patch files in the directory and generating them again,
and then emailing the series to yourself to verify that everything
matches up properly.

hope this helps,
