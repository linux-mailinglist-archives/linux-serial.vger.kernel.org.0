Andy (+cc) submitted a patch for the change you're requesting in January:

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20200122112306.64598-2-andriy.shevchenko@linux.intel.com/

The x86 maintainers haven't picked it up yet.

Ronald's patch fixes a regression.  Please apply it at your earliest
convenience.

Thanks,

Lukas
