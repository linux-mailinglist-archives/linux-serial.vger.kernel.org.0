This is a valid point - putting those parameters into DT would indeed allow
for more flexibility. Currently we are focusing on supporting a single LiteX
configuration (32-bit/8-bit bus) and that's why those parameters got fixed.

Adding support for other configurations however is not just changing those
two parameters (which should be fairly easy by itself), but also
handling different
registers layout for a single peripheral (in different configurations
CSRs offsets and sizes may differ).

Since this adds another layer of complexity we want to start with a simpler
version that can be extended in the future.

Using a different LiteX configuration 32-bit/32-bit bus would solve
the problem -
a single LiteX CSR would map nicely to a single 32-bit memory pointer and no
loop/locks would be needed.

In the default configuration (32-bit/8-bit bus) there are gaps between bytes
(as Gabriel Somlo already explained in his mail) which need to be handled
"manually".

Again - this is possible, but using a non-default 32-bit/32-bit bus LiteX
configuration.

TBH I never experienced bit layout inside a register to change by itself,
but I agree that using different bus width configurations causes CSRs
to be splitted into 4/2/1 32-bit registers (changing de facto the layout
from the SW perspective) - that's why we provide helper functions
in this file.

It is possible to have different configurations of a peripheral
in LiteX that e.g, turns features on/off - this might cause some CSRs
to shift and result in incompatibilities. There are ways in LiteX
to avoid such problems if the model is properly designed, though.

Another aspect of LiteX is that the order in which separate peripherals
(modules) are created results in a different memory map of the whole SoC.
This, however, is easily addressed by using a dynamically generated DT
and do not require the code of drivers to be altered in any way.
