So that means what, that no new users should use them?  Or that they
should be replaced?

No, please do not do that unless you can figure out why this is needed.

Only change code if it has to be changed.  If the idr api needs to be
redone for existing, working code, then that's fine, but do it correctly
and understand why you are doing it.

My point being that if it were as simple as a search/replace, then the
developer who wrote that comment would have done it already, not that
this should be something that you should do :)

hope this helps,
