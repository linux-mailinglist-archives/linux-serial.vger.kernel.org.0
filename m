Let me try to elaborate here:

Here we are dealing with 2 different layers of deferring work, one is
irq_work (NMI safe) using "struct irq_work" and other is normal
workqueue (NMI unsafe) using "struct work_struct".

So when we are in NMI context, the only option is to use irq_work to
defer work and need to pass reference to "struct irq_work". Now in
following irq_work function:

+void queue_work_nmi(struct irq_work *iw)
+{
+       struct work_struct *work = container_of(iw, struct work_struct, iw);
+
+       queue_work(system_wq, work);
+}
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(queue_work_nmi);

we can't find a reference to "struct work_struct" until there is 1:1
mapping with "struct irq_work". So we require a way to establish this
mapping and having "struct irq_work" as part of "struct work_struct"
tries to achieve that. If you have any better way to achieve this, I
can use that instead.
