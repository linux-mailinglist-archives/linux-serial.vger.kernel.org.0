I thought it should work automagically when there is proper hardware
RTS/CTS support, and I'm still not convinced it doesn't.

I admittedly didn't expect upper level to call set_mctrl() to deassert
RTS manually when driver has claimed hardware flow control, but even if
it does, it seems like it could be safely ignored, see below.

Why? Doesn't kernel stop its receiving machinery anyway when software
receive buffers get filled?

If it does, that seems logical, then it will rather stop reading from
FIFO, and once FIFO fills above threshold (if at all), hardware will
de-assert RTS by itself, no complications required.

OTOH, if kernel doesn't stop receiving, and RTS/CTS handshake is off or
is not obeyed by sender, kernel will continue to read from FIFO (and
discard data) even when software buffers are full, potentially
indefinitely. Somehow I doubt it's indeed the case.

What do I miss?
