I was trying to get you to describe symptoms at a higher level - as I
said above, at the application level - what were you using that wasn't
working that led you down the path to investigate this?   Transfering
data wasn't reaching the expected max for baud rate, or serial console
was showing lags and dropped characters, or ...?

The false positive error bits description is fine, but it isn't
something that a person in the future could read and then say "Oh I'm
having the same problem - I should backport that!"

I was hoping that with the full description of the issue from 12+ years
ago that you'd be able to reproduce it on your platform with the WAR disabl=
ed.
I take it that you tried and SysRQ still worked fine?

I also found a copy of an earlier proposed fix from 2010 on patchworks:
http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/linuxppc-dev/patch/20100301212324.GA173=
8@windriver.com/

Maybe there are some additional details in there of interest?

I wonder if some other intervening change in that wide time span happens
to mask the issue?  Who knows.  I'm not sure if you are that interested;
enough to go try an old kernel to find out...

If I recall correctly, it just clears BI - are you sure it sets bits?

I'm not in any position to declare any requirements - just that when you
are bit-bashing to work around some "black box" silicon errata, any
changes might impact whether the WAR is still working or not.

Your change alters lsr_saved_flags for *every* event, even when no breaks
or workarounds have been in play.  I'm not sure what that might trigger.

That might be the best option in the end but I did notice something else
you might want to consider.  I believe the fsl8250_handle_irq() was just
a copy of the generic serial8250_handle_irq() as it was in 2011, with
the single block of code inserted for the WAR:

+       /* This is the WAR; if last event was BRK, then read and return */
+       if (unlikely(up->lsr_saved_flags & UART_LSR_BI)) {
+               up->lsr_saved_flags &=3D ~UART_LSR_BI;
+               port->serial_in(port, UART_RX);
+               spin_unlock_irqrestore(&up->port.lock, flags);
+               return 1;
+       }

Of course as we all know - when you copy something, you risk being left
behind when the original gets updated.  I just took a look at today's
generic 8250 one -- "git blame drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_port.c" and
there are changes that probably have left fsl8250_handle_irq() being
left behind.  A bit more detective work would be required to see
changes prior to the refactoring in the 2015 commit of b6830f6df891.

It probably would be worthwhile to return fsl8250_handle_irq() to be the
"equivalent" of serial8250_handle_irq() + WAR as it was originally.  It
would be hard to argue against mainlining such changes - they are table
stakes.  And who knows, with a bit of luck it might solve your issue too?

Of couse that is more effort than to just stop using the workaround, so I
wouldn't blame you at all if you decided to go that route.
