The touchscreen is something different: I can easily mount that type of
touchscreen on my own board, while I cannot integrate a Samsung serial
port on my board, unless I'm using a Samsung SoC.

A weak dependency can be expressed using "|| COMPILE_TESTING".

<(not so) wild idea>
During the past few days, I've been giving this more thought.
And I realized we might as well get rid of pci_driver, and just have
platform_drivers that match against "pci<VendorID>,<DeviceID>" (yes,
this is what real Open Firmware had in the compatible property, cfr.
http://users.telenet.be/geertu/Linux/PPC/pci/ethernetAT4/).
That way there would be no longer a build dependency on CONFIG_PCI, and
we can drop all "depends on PCI" from driver Kconfig symbols.
But would dropping that dependency be welcomed? Perhaps, as "everybody"
uses PCI.

Now repeat the exercise for Zorro, TURBOchannel, NuBus, Sbus, PCMCIA,
..., and wait for the outcry from Linus suddenly seeing lots of
questions about support for hardware he can't possibly have in his
machine...
