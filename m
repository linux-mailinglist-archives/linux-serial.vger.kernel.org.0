Why is this really all needed as we have the SysRq handlers that report
all of this today?

This does not feel like something that the tty core code should be doing
at all.

That's what SysRq is for.  If there's a specific set of values that we
don't currently report in that facility, why not just add the
information there?  It's much simpler and "safer" that way.
