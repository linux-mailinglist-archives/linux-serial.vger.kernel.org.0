See Documentation/memory-barriers.txt, the section "KERNEL I/O BARRIER 
EFFECTS"

According to the specification, there must be a barrier before a write to 
the MMIO space (paragraph 3) and after a read from MMIO space (parahraph 
4) - if this causes unnecessary slowdown, the driver should use 
readX_relaxed or writeX_relaxed functions - the *_relaxed functions are 
ordered with each other (see the paragraph "(*) readX_relaxed(), 
writeX_relaxed()"), but they are not ordered with respect to memory 
access.

The commit 92d7223a74 fixes that requirement (although there is no real 
driver that was fixed by this), so I don't think it should be reverted. 
The proper fix should be to add delays to the serial port and readltime 
clock (or perhaps to all IO-port accesses).

If the MIPS port doesn't have MMIO barrier after read[bwl], then it is 
violating the specification. Perhaps there is no existing driver that is 
hurt by this violation, so this violation survived.
