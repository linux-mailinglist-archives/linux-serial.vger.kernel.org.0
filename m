Funny thing.  Even though sm501.c does not use mfd-core at all, it does
request resources for all its child devices, except for the uart
children.

sm501_register_usbhost(), sm501_register_display() and
sm501_register_gpio() all creates/requests resources.  But
sm501_register_uart() does not.

How many concrete examples are needed to convince you that what I am
trying to do is how it is done everywhere else (than
serial8250_core.c/serial8250_port.c, even in other 8250_*.c drivers)
(obviously not 100% true, there are ofcourse other pieces of code not
working well with resource management) ?

No.  If it was, then all (most) mfd drivers added after 2008 are hacky
workarounds, because the use mfd_add_devices().

There are currently 53 drivers in drivers/mfd/ that calls
mfd_add_devices() with one or more cells with resources attached.

Are they all hacky workarounds?

I am not trying to do anything that they are not already doing.

I am not trying to fix the problem of having multiple drivers owning the
same resource.  I am just trying to make serial8250 driver behave so it
can use the resources that it is handed by mfd-core.

This really is how it (mfd and also device resource management) is
designed.  I am not inventing anything, or making a workaround.

Actually, you should take a look at the following specialized 8250
8250_aspeed_vuart.c
8250_bcm2835aux.c
8250_dw.c
8250_em.c
8250_ingenic.c
8250_lpc18xx.c
8250_mtk.c
8250_omap.c
8250_pxa.c
8250_uniphier.c

They all use platform_get_resource(), and will work nicely with mfd.
And of-course, none of them use request_mem_region().

So, if you want to insist that I create a clone of the current standard
serial8250 driver (serial8250_isa_driver in 8520_core.c), even though I
want absolutely nothing specialized, just need it to play nicely with
platform_get_resource(), what should I call the driver?  8520_plat.c ?

If that was the case, then mfd-core would be implemented in order to not
work with existing platform drivers.  There definitely is an issue
here.  And it is in 8250_core.c and 8250_port.c.

Point taken.  I haven't put much focus on that.  But I don't see how
that is going to help making use of serial8250_isa_driver in combination
with mfd_add_devices().  I am not creating/requesting the resources.
That is done by mfd_add_device(), which I fail to see why I would need
to change.

I believe all my comments were related to this same resource management
discussion.
