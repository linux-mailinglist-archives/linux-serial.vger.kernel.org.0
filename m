I don't have a ton of intuition about how the new "serial_port" code
is designed to work. The patch that added it mentioned that it was
based on suggestions by a whole bunch of people but there were no
links to the previous discussions so it wasn't easy to get tons of
context. I would certainly love it if people who have been involved
could chime in and say whether my patch is correct. If anyone has any
suggestions for something better to say in the commit message I'm
happy to use different wording as well.

In any case, looking at it I guess a serdev device would use
serdev_device_wait_until_sent() to ensure its command was sent. That
eventually seems to trickle down to the UART function tx_empty(). If a
serdev device needs to block suspend while waiting then that would be
up to the serdev device. This could be implicit if the
serdev_device_wait_until_sent() was being called as part of the serdev
device's suspend() function or perhaps could be through some sort of
locking.

...so really I think the case we're running into is if userspace has a
whole bunch of bytes queued up to write out the UART. That shouldn't
block suspend. If userspace needs to block suspend they should use
another method.

Yeah, I'll fix that to "regular". I'll wait (probably till Tuesday)
before sending a v2.

Somehow I thought it was supposed to be, but you're right that it
looks weird. I guess the docs call it "runtime PM" so I'll change all
instances to that in v2.
