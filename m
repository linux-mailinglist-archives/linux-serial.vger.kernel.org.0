I'd prefer that. The name tty_flip_buffer_push() is more descriptive and
we've been using it in virtually all tty drivers since 1997. No need to
force people to relearn the pattern of tty insert + push.

(Also note that the kernel doc for tty_schedule_flip() says "push
characters to ldisc", while the name more reflects how the tty buffering
was originally implemented.)

Even if all it said was "random cleanups" it would still be worth having
as I'd know that this is just Jiri moving code about and not necessarily
something that needs deeper review.

In this case the driver commit messages only said that "[w]e are going
to remove [tty_flip_buffer_push()]" without any real explanation why
that was chosen over the alternatives. I had to look up the series on
lore to look for more details. But since there's no cover letter I end
up having to skim the entire series only to come up mostly empty handed
as the final patch just added "One less exported function" as some sort
of motivation.

Let's not make it harder for reviewers. If you're sending random cleanup
patches then say so. And if they can be grouped into a few classes as
seemed to be the case here then having those outlined is also helpful.
