Yes, PCI subfunctions would have been much nicer, with direct drivers
and no auxiliary/platform stuff in between. But these were not
supported by the FPGA vendor.

Yes, the only changes are bugfixes. The register interface must be kept
compatible. Like a microcontroller with a firmware which implements an
USB device.
