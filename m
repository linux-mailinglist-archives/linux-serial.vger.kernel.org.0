This race should not happen because Both exclusive_console and
exclusive_console_stop_seq are manipulated under console_lock.
And the log is replayed before console_lock is released.

IMHO, the problem is that the log should not be replayed at all.
See the following code in register_console():

	/*
	 * If we have a bootconsole, and are switching to a real console,
	 * don't print everything out again, since when the boot console, and
	 * the real console are the same physical device, it's annoying to
	 * see the beginning boot messages twice
	 */
	if (bcon && ((newcon->flags & (CON_CONSDEV | CON_BOOT)) == CON_CONSDEV))
		newcon->flags &= ~CON_PRINTBUFFER;

I already see two problems there:

1. CON_PRINTBUFFER is cleared only when the new console has
   CON_CONSDEV flag set. It is set only for the console
   that is defined as the last on the command line.
   It is a so-called preferred console.

2. bcon is set to the first console in console_drivers list.
   It is the first registered boot console.

Sigh, this works for simple configuration. But it fails badly when
more different consoles are configured.

We should clear CON_PRINTBUFFER flag when the real console
replacing an already registered boot console is registered.

BTW: Similar bug is also at the end of register_console().
The boot consoles are unregistered only when the preferred
console is installed.

For a proper solution we would need to match boot and real
consoles that write messages into the physical device.
But I am afraid that there is no support for this.
con->match() callback compares the name defined on
the command line. And it has side effects (the matching
console is prepared for registration).

To be honest I am not much familiar with the device interface.
I am not sure if there is a way to detect the two drivers
use the same physical hardware.

Sigh, it is a huge historical mess. It would needed a lot
of work to clean it up.

Best Regards,
Petr
