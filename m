"depends on PCI" describes the hardware bus that a driver depends on.

PLAT_FOO is just trying to somehow classify that this type of driver
only shows up on this vendor's devices.  It is not defining the hardware
at all.  We try to always describe functionality of hardware, not try to
declare specific vendor's hardware choices, right?

PLAT_FOO is interesting, but given that a specific driver is really not
tied to that platform logically, only by virtue that no one else might
not happen to have that hardware, it seems odd to have that.

Yes, asking lots of questions is tough, but we passed that problem so
long ago.  Are we now trying to add PLAT_FOO entries to all hardware
drivers in order to make this type of selection easier?  I thought we
were just doing that by providing defconfig files to make the initial
selection saner.
