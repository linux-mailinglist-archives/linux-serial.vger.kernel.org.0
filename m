Hi, this is your Linux kernel regression tracker.

Zhang Xiaoxu, was this ever addressed? Doesn't look like it, but maybe I
misse dsomething. I'm asking because I noticed a regression report with
a similar failure msg:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=216847

```

Or is that a totally different issue?

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

P.S.: As the Linux kernel's regression tracker I deal with a lot of
reports and sometimes miss something important when writing mails like
this. If that's the case here, don't hesitate to tell me in a public
reply, it's in everyone's interest to set the public record straight.
