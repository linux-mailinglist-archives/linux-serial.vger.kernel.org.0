Ack, I'll drop it.

I had it as that originally, but these aren't power domains. These are 
power management domains (they can clock *and* power gate separately, 
where supported) plus also do reset management. So I wasn't sure if it 
was really fair calling them "power-domain" at that point.

One or more (if there are none the property should not exist). I guess 
that should be encoded.

Ah, I'd missed that one! I'm glad there's an existing binding for this 
already.

Yup, I'll do it like that for v2.

Thanks!
