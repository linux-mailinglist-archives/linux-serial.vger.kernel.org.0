Ah, I remember the discrete power domains but I missed this syscon.

I see this is mostly used for poweroff/reboot, which makes sense in this 
context. For pmgr though, the binding only describes the uniform power 
state registers, so I think I'm comfortable leaving it as a simple-mfd. 
Other pmgr sub-blocks will probably end up as separate nodes with 
different bindings anyway (e.g. whatever I do for the clock muxes, need 
to see how that ties in with audio which I think is the only consumer so 
far).

If things get more complicated in future SoCs then we can change how we 
do it on those, of course :)
