Thank you Michal for kindly taking the time to explain this in detail, that was very helpful.

I've now looked at this more closely and experimented with different combinations of ps_uart, AXI 
Uartlite, mdm_uart and AXI UART16550A. Relevant observations (Michal you'll know most of this):

1. The Xilinx DTG adds the "port-number" property to all Zynq/Zynq-US Cadence UARTs, AXI Uartlite, 
mdm_uart and AXI UART16550A (it's only documented so far in the DT-binding file for uartlite)

2. The current "port-number" mechanism in the Xilinx DTG enumerates in the order in which they are 
listed in the MSS file generated by proprietary Xilinx binaries, be it Vitis/XSCT or 
petalinux-config. The only exception is when the MSS file declares a UART the OS serial_console, 
then that one gets 0 and everyone else follows (this is required because the DTG also always sets 
the kernel bootarg for console to ttyPS_0_ , ttyUL_0_ , etc.)

3. For one type of driver (uartps, uartns, uartlite), the Xilinx binaries list the UARTs in the MSS 
file strictly alphabetically by HW_INSTANCE name (that's even true if I mix AXI Uartlites and 
mdm_uarts, which both use the uartlite driver). So the port-numbers follow strictly (with the 
console exception) and reproducibly.

4. The Xilinx DTG gives "serial" aliases to _all_ said UARTs, however the order is different than 
the port-numbers/the MSS order:

4.1. ps_uarts (and I suppose other cadence uarts) come first; if ps_uart1 is declared console in the 
MSS, it gets "serial0", even if there is ps_uart0, which then gets "serial1".

4.2. other UARTs get higher serial aliases, however the order can mix UARTs of different drivers, 
like Uartlite and AXI16550. This order is not based on MSS, memory addresses, instance names or even 
order added or interconnect ports in the Vivado Block Design. It is intransparent to me even after 
looking at devicetree.tcl and seems to change with different combinations of PL UARTs

4.3. even if I declare a Uartlite as the boot console for both u-boot and the Linux kernel in the 
PetaLinux menuconfig, "serial0" still goes to the ps_uart (that uartlite becomes the first other 
serial*, though). This is unfortunate because the early bootarg is "serial0:115200n8", so all the 
early kernel output still goes out over the ps_uart against the configuration.


Lastly I would like to observe that the patch I sent in to git@xilinx.com for the Xilinx DTG
a) preserves the port-numbering in MSS order for each driver type (uartps, uartns, uartlite)
b) preserves the special port-number=<0> treatment for the UART declared the OS console
but
c) enumerates up consecutively from 0 per driver (uartps,uartns,uartlite), therefore fixing the 
allocation issue brought into focus by the introduction of the SERIAL_UARTLITE_NR_UARTS parameter to 
the kernel. The order is reliable and reproducible because it is dependent on the MSS structure. The 
same is not true for the "serial" alias.

Michal, as you have kindly explained above, there cannot be serial aliases with the same number, and 
in combination with the unpredictable numbering of non-cadence uarts, the "serial" alias mechanism 
is unsuitable right now to properly deal with multiple UART types which will pop up in FPGA systems.


I therefore respectfully urge Xilinx to adopt my DTG patch. It does not break anything and keeps 
numbering as reliable as it is right now, but it fixes the inconsistency with kernel numbering policy.


Since Xilinx tool and Linux kernel development are not synced-up, changes on either side should not 
break the other; the DTG patch does not break the Linux side. The /tty/serial/uartlite.c patch that 
we are discussing in the separate thread
  "[PATCH v2] serial: uartlite: Move out-of-range port-numbers into ULITE_NR_UARTS range"
is a fix for what the DTG does right now, but does not break with either version.

Best wishes and thanks for your time,
Ruediger
