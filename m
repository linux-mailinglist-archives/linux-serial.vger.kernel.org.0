The patch can definitely be considered a hack, but viewed with another
lens: a bugfix.

There is no specific reason that the call should return an EIO on hung
terminals, so making it always return the current value could be
considered more correct. POSIX tcgetwinsize(), which this ioctl maps
to, does not consider hung terminals, and expects it to return suitable
values whenever possible.

Userspace implementations will have to reconsider their handling of an
EIO error, as the isatty() call could still return an EIO if calling
into a non-TTY device. Unconditionally mapping it to a success, like
isatty_safe() in systemd, would be an error. Supporting both versions
would require a runtime check to determine which variant is used, where
the legacy version would accept the risk of a "wrong" EIO, while the
new version would treat it as a proper error.

isatty() should not need to know if the TTY is hung, and besides cannot
safely call any ioctl to check this before it knows that it is indeed a
TTY. POSIX does not seem to include the concept of hung terminals.

A case could be made for introducing a new ioctl though, but it would
need a more generic approach, like the BSD FIODTYPE ioctl that exposes
a d_type property on chardev & block driver interfaces. If implemented
before calling into the VFS layer, it could make the isatty() call 100%
safe (on kernels that support the ioctl). Additionally, this would mean
that it can never return EIO, which makes userspace adaptions simpler,
since it can know that any returned EIO means that it is running on an
unpatched/legacy kernel and/or libc.
