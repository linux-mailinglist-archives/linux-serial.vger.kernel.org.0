Correct, since frame_time is from 31f6bd7fad3b and the function is from f90=
08285bb69,
we would need both.

From the snippets in 8250_port.c that I have looked at,
I think it's safe to assume that it is >=3D 1 as long as it is defined,
and there are several spots that check whether or not it has been defined y=
et.

If not defined it takes the value from the constant fifo_size which is defi=
ned
for each port type to be at least 1, except for one, PORT_8250_CIR,
which most likely will never use this function anyway,
it causes many steps to be skipped in serial8250_register_8250_port().

When I said "some hardware-specific workaround" that was just a guess.

I decided to take a deep dive into the rabbit hole to find the source:

With the pre-git-history git repo from archive.org, I have traced the=20
first instance of the comment ".02 seconds of slop" to Linux 2.1.15.

However, it is not the first instance of adding an arbitrary `HZ/50`
to a delay to make "something" work, that would be in Linux 1.3.88
for the file net/ipv4/tcp_input.c for use in tcp_send_delayed_ack().

In the 90's, each version came in the form of a single bulk patch of patche=
s,
so I went hunting for the original patch.

27 years ago, Theodore T'so sent this patch to Linus and the mailing list:
(almost as old as me...)
(I can't find this one on lkml.org !!!)
https://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/9612.0/0501.html

Unfortunately, there's not much comment about the "slop",
but some talk of POSIX conformance and timing becoming stricter,
especially the comment which is still in master:

  * Note: we have to use pretty tight timings here to satisfy
  * the NIST-PCTS.

and

  Wait for the characters to drain based on
  info->timeout. At low baud rates (50bps), it may take a
  long time for the FIFO to completely drain out!

This makes me believe that it was added just for extra room in the timeout
to make sure that an _exact_ value for a timeout would not be too close
to a real-life absolute minimum that could cause data loss.

I noted that the `HZ/50` also appears in the same patch for defining char_t=
ime,
the timeout adds the extra time, and then char_time uses the timeout withou=
t it.

I went looking for the most recent change to char_time and found your commi=
t 31f6bd7fad3b
(so I really went full circle this time...)
And since port->timeout has been fully replaced and the calculations separa=
ted,
there's no issue with removing the extra time from char_time but not the ti=
meout.

However, it's clear from the inline comments that these lines were added
at a time when HZ was a constant, whereas now in modern Linux it can be var=
iable,
like in the cases in version 2.1.15:

$ git grep 'HZ/50'
drivers/char/serial.c:=09=09info->timeout +=3D HZ/50;=09=09/* Add .02 secon=
ds of slop */
drivers/char/serial.c:=09=09char_time =3D (info->timeout - HZ/50) / info->x=
mit_fifo_size;
drivers/net/shaper.h:#define SHAPER_BURST=09(HZ/50)=09=09/* Good for >128K =
then */
include/net/route.h:#define RT_REDIRECT_LOAD=09=09(HZ/50) /* 20 msec */
net/ipv4/tcp_input.c:=09=09if (tp->ato < HZ/50)
net/ipv4/tcp_input.c:=09=09=09tp->ato =3D HZ/50;
net/ipv4/tcp_timer.c:=09=09when=3DHZ/50;


And in master there are still a few of these...

$ git grep 'seconds of slop'
drivers/tty/amiserial.c:=09info->timeout +=3D HZ/50;=09=09/* Add .02 second=
s of slop */
drivers/tty/mxser.c:=09info->timeout =3D timeout + HZ / 50; /* Add .02 seco=
nds of slop */
drivers/tty/synclink_gt.c:=09info->timeout +=3D HZ/50;=09=09/* Add .02 seco=
nds of slop */
include/linux/serial_core.h:=09/* Add .02 seconds of slop */

but less of these...

$ git grep 'HZ/50' net drivers/net include/net
drivers/net/ethernet/dec/tulip/interrupt.c:=09=09=09=09mod_timer(&tp->timer=
, RUN_AT(HZ/50));
drivers/net/ethernet/dec/tulip/interrupt.c:=09=09=09mod_timer(&tp->timer, R=
UN_AT(HZ/50));
drivers/net/wireless/virtual/mac80211_hwsim.c:=09ieee80211_queue_delayed_wo=
rk(hw, &hwsim->roc_start, HZ/50);


On a side note: in file drivers/tty/amiserial.c
The "NIST-PCTS" comment is there,
and char_time is defined using port->timeout and the `HZ/50` still.
This is harder to find because the function name differs from serial_core.c=
:
uart_wait_until_sent() was originally also named rs_wait_until_sent()
and that was also changed before the mainline git history started...

So in summary, I do believe the `HZ/50` or similar should be replaced
in all of the cases in drivers/tty, maybe `frame_time * (fifosize + 1)`
for FIFO, and in the other cases, it might be safe to remove altogether,
as long as very low baud rates are tested. But also, it might not be a bad =
idea
for someone to take a look at the usage of `HZ` throughout the kernel,
since it is no longer constant and these lines that were originally meant t=
o be
an equivalence to seconds still seem to be lingering around in some areas..=
.

And if you do decide to change/remove it, you can try to CC Theodore
and maybe he can explain it to us himself. :D
