Isn't a Za64rs reservation set related to atomic operations,
though?  They are related to load-reserved/store conditional
instructions, which are introduced in the atomic instructions
section.

I was mistaken about Zicclsm, that's related to unaligned
accesses, but does not apply to atomic operations.

Yes I think this is a better way to handle it.  Conor?

Yes I think you should do this once there is concensus.

That's fine.  I don't think I felt strongly about any of the things
I said about the exact wording used here.

Thanks.
