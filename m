I didn't suggest to revert the commit, as it obviously solves real
problem. I asked if and why the lock is needed on non-SMP targets, but
either I didn't get a reply or missed it, sorry.

I mean everything I said was to get some help rather than to spread
useless critics or even insults.

I'm in the process of making myself familiar with the internals of
printk machinery to find generic solution, but if nobody else actually
cares, I'll stop bothering you guys with my questions.

Do I get it right that you still think there are no sensible options but
to disable interrupts for ages? If so, it would greatly reduce my drive
to find one... or maybe the other way round, but it'd be nice to know
either way.

Do I get it right that it's covered by the 'oops' case, or are there
hidden pitfalls as well?

Thanks,
