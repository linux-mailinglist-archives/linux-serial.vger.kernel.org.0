Hi linux-serial and Greg,

Yocto Linux distro maintainer Richard Purdie is seeing a regression or behavior
change after updating kernel from 6.4 to 6.5. Yocto runs a lot of automated tests with qemu
where a python test framework configures and spawns qemu (version 8.1) with two
serial ports and boots a newly built kernel and rootfs there. The python test framework
tries to detect getty login prompt from ttyS1 while boot time logging
from qemu, kernel, userspace etc happens on serial console ttyS0. This has worked
reliably for years and across multiple kernel versions. Now with 6.5 kernel there are
suddenly frequent failures where ttyS1 doesn't show the login prompt in the python code
which listens on the qemu socket from target system ttyS1. The target system ttyS0 is working
and boot time logs and getty prompt are visible there. The ttyS1 logs from test framework show
that only two characters CR and LF make it through. This same happens on x86_64 host
running qemu machine for x86_64 and arm64 targets.

The kernel boot logs from target system with 6.5.5 don't show any errors and getty
processes are started correctly and they don't see any errors either. Data from
target system userspace is being written, but seems to sometimes hang inside kernel
or qemu serial port buffers, and only on the ttyS1 while ttyS0 works reliably all
the time.

Example target logs with 6.5.5 via ttyS0:

https://autobuilder.yocto.io/pub/failed-builds-data/6.5%20kernel/j/qemu_boot_log.20231007084853
or https://pastebin.com/raw/jRRa2CwW

ttyS1 logs from the same run:
https://autobuilder.yocto.io/pub/failed-builds-data/6.5%20kernel/j/qemu_boot_log.20231007084853.2

Kernel config:
https://pastebin.com/raw/Lv9Hfeuh

Do you have any ideas or hints how to debug or possibly fix this?

tty layer has seen quite a few major changes between 6.4.14 and 6.5.5 and we're not able
to pinpoint or bisect the issue, since it so annoyingly rare.

Some more details from Richard below.

Cheers,

-Mikko
