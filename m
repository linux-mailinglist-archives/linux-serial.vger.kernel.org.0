We discussed it some times ago, and the conclusion was that reads and 
writes to the same device are not reordered on Alpha. Reads and writes to 
different devices or to memory may be reordered.

In these problematic cases, we only access serial port or real time clock 
using a few ports (and these devices don't have DMA, so there's not any 
interaction with memory) - so I conclude that it is timing problem and not 
I/O reordering problem.
