Hello Paul,

first of all thanks for your cooperation on this ancient topic. It's
very appreciated.

And oh, I failed to Cc the NXP people. I added them to Cc:, maybe one of
them can add something valuable to the discussion.

The problem is "However it also stores other error bits and so after a
single frame error the character received in the next irq handling is
passed to the upper layer with a frame error, too." which is just the
sentence before. I hoped this would be understandable :-\

The current state is (assuming the errata is accurate and I understood
it correctly):=20
 - You get a problem for sure if there is a frame error (because the
   next good char is thrown away).
 - You get a problem for sure if there is a parity error (because the
   next good char is thrown away).
 - You get a problem for sure if there was an overflow (because the
   first good char after the overflow is thrown away).
 - The code is racy for break handling. In some unlikely cases the break
   workaround is applied wrongly.

(Where "thrown away" is really: passed to the tty layer with an error
indication, which depending on tty settings results in dropping the
character or passing it on to userspace.)

My patch only fixes the first three issues. A part of the reason for the
uncomplete fix is that I don't have a platform that requires the workaround.
(I thought I had, but it doesn't show the described behaviour and
instead behaves nicely, i.e. one irq per break and no stray bits are
set.)

That the patch I did is correct is quite obvious for me. Currently the
fsl8250_handle_irq() function sets the bits BI, OE, FE and PE in
lsr_saved_flags, but only evaluates BI for the workaround. The commit
that introduced that only talks about BI, the mentioned erratum also
only mentions BI.

I can try to make the commit log more convincing. Or if the ability to
test this code on an affected platform is declared a requirement, I will
drop the topic, just stop using fsl8250_handle_irq() without feeling sad.

Best regards
Uwe
