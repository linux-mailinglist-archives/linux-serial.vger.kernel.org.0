Yeah, sure. So it does mean interrupts could be disabled for up to 1
second, on already up and running system. Too bad.

Actually, I use 8250 only as a reference implementation, my actual
chip is handled by imx.c, and the latter even has no timeouts on this
path, so apparently may block (the entire kernel) indefinitely!

70us of disabled interrupts is a huge number, and for FIFO-enabled chips
the estimate should be multiplied by FIFO size (say, x16) that brings us
close to 1ms even on 115200, right?

Anyway, it must cause receiving overruns on another port running at
higher or the same baud rate and no DMA, sooner or later, as it does
for me.

I don't care about slowing-down boot. I care about huge interrupt
latency on up and running system, causing loss of characters  (overruns)
on other serial ports.

To be sure, it is this code that works on already running system as
well, not only on boot-time, right? Or is my system somehow
misconfigured?

I'm confused as this seems to be a major issue and nobody but me seems
to care or to suffer from it, and I can't figure why.

For reference, I figured this locking was introduced by:

    [SERIAL] 8250: add locking to console write function
    
    x86 SMP breaks as a result of the previous change, we have no real
    option other than to add locking to the 8250 console write function.
    If an oops is in progress, try to acquire the lock.  If we fail to
    do so, continue anyway.

It seems like I need to, and yeah, it'd be a somewhat tough task indeed,
but then there is one simple question: why isn't console output handled
through usual buffer/ISR paths?

I have an idea to investigate the netconsole module to see how it does
similar job for networks. Hopefully it has no such problems and will
give some useful tips. 

Thanks,
