Drivers calling of_platform_populate or devm_of_platform_populate.

That of course does mean you need a driver. We could probably make the
syscon driver call these if needed.

That would have saved you, but deferred probe is now a fallback to
fw_devlink and it makes sure parent driver probes first. That works
unless there isn't a parent driver which is often the case for
simple-bus[1]. I think you are okay since 'syscon' means there is a
driver.

Just swapping seems like less work, but either way.
