The wheel with octagonal shape is still not perfect. I made it more
smoother. Your implementation in recommended commit use an active
waiting (pl011_rs485_tx_start, pl011_rs485_tx_stop) and that could
cause lots of problems in upper layers of tty driver or application.
I think you forgot to implement possibility to start TX during
"delay after send", too.

The 8250_port.c use DMA. Do you thin that it shoud be moved to
serial_core.c? If there will be default implementation of handling
RTS by serial_core.c using timers, than I will refactor this driver
to use it.

I do not see any used thread in link:
https://github.com/RevolutionPi/linux/commit/0099313962a5
I am not kernel thread expert but I think that thread is not as
lightweight as hrtimer. According to my knowledge the hrtimer use some
kind of interrupt. Compare to this the kthread is created as thread
with all its scheduling structures. Did you implemented proper thread
shutdown? Has the thread right priority? There are many questions
like this...

I think that thread with main purpose to wait is waist of resources.
This kind of task should be handled by timers. I saw this passion for
threads in Windows CE 6 drivers. Did you read some of them?

This would be wasting of CPU time and as I mentioned above it can cause
problems in above layers. Busy-wait in any method require deep
knowledge of "caller".

TX interrupt is used by other parts of driver. I would not recommend to
change this behavior without complete analysis of buffer refill timing.
There can be some devices which can be "IDLE" sensitive. This devices
would not work properly on higher baud rates.
I do not use busy-wait in timer tick. If there is data in FIFO I do not
stop timer and let it tick one more time.


Thanks,

Ivan
