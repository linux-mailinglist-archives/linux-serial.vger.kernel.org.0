I believe there is no need to do this support.

Most of the platform code that uses it is quite legacy, and all under arch/
ideally should be converted to use Device Tree.

So, does it have an issue?

I tired to repeat, that is OKAY! You *may* split and supply resources to the
drivers, nothing prevents you to do that with current code base.

Do you see any problem with that? What is that problem?

If you would like utilize serial8250, just provide a platform data for it.

If you need some specifics, you create a driver with whatever name
suits the IP in question. Nevertheless, if it's simple generic 8250, nothing
needs to be added, except platform data, see above.

I simple can't understand why it's needed. What problem would it solve which
can't be solved with existing code base?

So, briefly looking at it I didn't find any deviations from a standard 16550a.

Also there are two drivers mentioned Xilinx, though I'm pretty sure it's not
your case.

Since you have more than one of them, it's even smaller to use current
infrastructure to enumerate them using only one serial8250 description.
See plenty examples in the Linux kernel, such as 8250_exar_st16c554.c.
That is what you may just modify for your needs and put inside your MFD.
