You did something else too than just that because you cannot cleanly 
revert just e8ffbb71f783. Please indicate what happened to:
  f8d6e9d3ca5c ("serial: 8250: Fix __stop_tx() & DMA Tx restart races")

I guess you reverted that too and forgot to mention about it but I just 
want to be sure we're on the same page?

Okay, and you're sure the problem/corruption occurs on the receiving side? 

Maybe the the extra interrupt that the tx side change will trigger somehow 
causes the confusion on the rx side. So that would be an extra call into 
handle_rx_dma() that could either do an extra flush or start DMA Rx that 
would not occur w/o that tx side change.

How easy this is to trigger in general? (Mainly trying to gauge how 
easy it will be to find the read and/or the irq that related to the 
corrupted payload).

That change also removed what IMO was a too early serial8250_rpm_put_tx()
which is not just RS485 related but yes, the main reason was to have the
half-duplex RS485 behave correctly.
