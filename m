Under my test, this code will not work:

p->serial_out(p, UART_MCR, up->mcr | UART_MCR_LOOP);
dw8250_force_idle(p);
/* waiting until not busy... */

Current byte maybe not finished when we set UART_MCR_LOOP and reset fifo,
dw-uart will continue receive even if LOOP bit is set. After this byte
is finished it will push data to rx fifo and remark BUSY flag again.
That's why I leave dw8250_force_idle inside to loop.

Or maybe we should make dw8250_force_idle after ndelay such as:

p->serial_out(p, UART_MCR, up->mcr | UART_MCR_LOOP);
ndelay(p->frame_time);
dw8250_force_idle(p);

But that requires a test to see if it works.
