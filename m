I was waiting for a reply in discussion for this patch...
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-serial/20210927093704.19768-1-pali@kernel.org/t/#u

There was no reply, so I was surprised it was taken without any
reaction. I was really in impression that patch is waiting.

So sorry for that.

Johan, could you write comments below original patch, so discussion is
not on two places? I would really like to fix this issue because
c_ospeed contains incorrect value.
