kthread_work's API is greate for system which do not care about throughput but
concern with real-time performance. It is suitable for scenarios where a single
work instance corresponds to a single workqueue. In situations where a
workqueue corresponds to multiple different works, using kthread_work does not
create threads as needed. To address this, we might consider adding a new
interface, perhaps called kthread_run_workqueue. Unlike kthread_run_worker,
this new interface would determine whether to create a new thread based on the
pointer to the work instance passed in, ensuring that each work uniquely
corresponds to a thread. This approach has several advantages: it allows for
seamless switching between the existing workqueue's queue work logic and
kthread_work, and it can help avoid missing any work associated with a particular
workqueue, especially in large corebase containing multiple layers.
If the kthread_work API does not provide the functionality to create different
threads for different works, then I think a private worker pool is meaningful.
However, it may still lead to potential blocking for subsequent works if multiple
different works arrive concurrently while there is only one active kworker thread.

Indeed, WQ_RT cannot address the issue of multiple different works arriving
concurrently in the same worker pool leading to delays, as just mentioned.
The creation of new threads on demand in a work queue, from the perspective
of the current code implementation, is inherently non-real-time.
It seems that only the kthread_work mechanism can ensure that work tasks are
executed in real-time. I will use it to solve another GPU-related kworker
issue that I encounter in our system.

Regarding the current kworker preemption issue with 8250_dma, based on our
current measurements, using the kworker API is sufficient. Additionally, if
we switch to kthread_work, the tty driver layer would require significant
modifications. Therefore, I will adopt the WQ_SYSFS approach you mentioned,
as it is quite convenient for dynamic control from user space.
