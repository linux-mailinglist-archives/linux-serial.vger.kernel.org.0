I don't fully understand the point. Isn't the existing pps_ldisc module
already affecting the whole system ? (with it's builtin fixed
"options"). How different tunable options such as the proposal make
things fundamentally different ? Still I agree that per device settings
would be better.

I can retry on this track. However I believe , it will also need
support from userland utility (especially ldattach). I don't know if
this kind of consequences is in the scope of the discussion here.

Many of the x86 based SBC i've seen (with robotic/mobile devices) use
case have this kind of incomplete UARTs. I'd love if the perfect
hardware choice would be possible.
Also, is there a specific reason that I'm missing why the abuse (agreed
it is) of the primary CTS pin usage is of a different nature than the
abuse of the DCD pin already in place ?
Most GNSS boards I have seen only have RX, TX and don't even expose the
CTS/RTS. They provide the high precision PPS signal on a separate pin,
and being able to reuse the CTS pin from the host computer like a more
generic GPIO to handle would be nice (my opinion).

I'm not sure this is such odd hardware. A lot of recent GNSS boards I'm
handling only have RX&TX on their UARTs. This is the case for all Ublox
chips I've seen ; Septentrio new Mosaic chips have CTS/RTS, but flow
control is disabled by default and consumer PCB featuring the chip do
not expose those pins. In most (all those I know) cases the PPS signal
is provided on a separate non UART related pin. And many x86 SBC boards
that could pair (for whatever use case like robotic projects etc.) with
those GNSS boards have incomplete UARTs without DCD (and often no GPIO
that could be use for that purpose either. ARM based devices are often
better equipped from that point of view, but other constraints sometime
do not let you go to ARM hardware).

I don't know how to accuratly handle CTS handle from user space, only
type of handling in user space I have workaround is the inversion of
rising falling edge (e.g. with time1 offset and flag2 of ntpd PPS
driver : https://doc.ntp.org/archives/drivers/driver22/ ) but this
doesnt pair well with all kind of other drivers that carry the numeric
part of timing information). It's a matter of taste, but I dislike this
workaround even more than the CTS pin abuse.
