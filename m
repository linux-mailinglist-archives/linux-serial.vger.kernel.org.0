Sorry for the late response, the company exchange server does not work
for me at this moment, so I have to use the private email instead.

The issue is observed on omap8250 hardware (CPU: AM6548). the use case
is RS485 half-duplex (2 wire mode), in this mode the RTS pin is used to
control the direction and is software controller via the MCR[1]
register. The problem is that the RS485 transmitting is OK, but the
receiving is not working. Similar issue also exists for the RS422, i.e.
the 4-wire full-duplex mode of RS485, but this time the TX does not
work, RX is fine.

The MCR is set to 0 at this line within uart_port_startup():
	retval = uport->ops->startup(uport);

On omap8250, the startup() points to omap_8250_startup(), within it:
	up->mcr = 0;

For software controlled RTS pin of RS485 half-duplex, when not in the
transmitting, the MCR[1] should be constant to indicate the current
direction is receiving. This is set in serial8250_em485_stop_tx().

So after this point of setting the MCR to 0, this up->mcr register
mirror does not reflect the actual desired value anymore. Further
checking against it leads to false result.

Another possible fix could be, instead of setting the mcr to 0 blindly,
one could check if the current operating mode is RS485 half-duplex, and
if so, mask the MCR[1], so that this bit is not changed. Because the
MCR[1] will be changed to the correct value before TX in
serial8250_em485_start_tx(), this change would not impact the transmitting.
