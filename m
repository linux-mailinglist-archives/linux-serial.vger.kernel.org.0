Which list would that be?  There are over 100 occurrences of "DRM" in the
file MAINTAINERS.  I am also interested in this.  There is a very great
deal of functionality in drivers/tty/vt.  It will be quite a task to
replace it.

What would the boot console be?  Some console needs to be in place early
enough to be able to display "Kernel panic - unable to mount the root
partition".

Agreed.

Jiri pointed to some problems yesterday from his point of view as a SuSE
maintainer.  Perhaps kmscon just needs bringing back into maintenance.  I
haven't actually looked at it yet.

By the way, I'll be away from my email for a few days, so won't be able
to answer any posts in that time.
