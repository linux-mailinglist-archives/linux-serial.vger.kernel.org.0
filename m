It was already a mess.

I might put in that effort if there's a reasonable chance this change
will be accepted.  If it's going to be rejected regardless, I'd rather
not waste my time.

I followed the pattern of the existing SERIAL_8250_PNP option.  Was that
a mistake?  How would you prefer it?

There won't be /dev/ttyS devices for ports that don't exist.

Not if they had predictable numbers to begin with.

It means I have to somehow maintain a separate list of which ports are
real and which should be ignored, or else try to distinguish real errors
from those caused by trying to access the bogus ports.
