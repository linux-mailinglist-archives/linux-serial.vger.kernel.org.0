The "in" and "out" instructions are serializing on x86. But alpha doesn't 
have dedicated instructions for accessing ports.

Do you think that all the "in[bwl]" and "out[bwl]" macros on alpha should 
be protected by two memory barriers, to emulate the x86 behavior?

I think that the fact that "writeb" is posted is exactly the problem - it 
gets posted, the processor goes on, sends "readb" and they arrive 
back-to-back to the ISA bus. The ISA bus device doesn't like back-to-back 
accesses and locks up.

Anyway - you can change the "ndelay()" function in this patch to "mb()" - 
"mb()" will provide long enough delay that it fixes this bug.
