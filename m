This will vary for different hardware only if QUP version is lower than 
this.

We can not determine this dynamically because register address space to 
read QUP version is in QUP wrapper space and that also keep varying per 
target.

we only  get internal SE address base in cmdline arg.

HALF_SAMPLING controlls the sampling rate of UART HW, if not then logs 
come garbled due to wrong sampling.

Done the changes. Sorry, i compiled with the static config but missed to 
add back when compiled with  config change.

Uploaded new change.
