You should not add Reviewed-by on your own. Only after the person 
himself/herself gives that tag for you, include it.

Hmm, since this function is only one setting it to non-zero value, perhaps 
the information could be carried over here in a no_room local var (and 
maybe unlikely() would be useful too similar to n_tty_kick_worker). After 
all, this check is just an optimization for the common case where we know 
no_room is definitely zero.

This part is hard to parse/understand. Please try to rephrase.
