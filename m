... or allow modal changes to the uart driver when kgdboc comes up?

We already allow UART drivers to de-optimize themselves and use
different code paths when polling is enabled so its not totally crazy
;-).

Thanks for bringing this up.

Sumit and I were chatting last week and our discussion went in a similar
direction (I think not exactly the same which is why it is good to
see your thoughts too).

Personally I think it comes down to how intrusive adding NMI support is
to serial drivers. kgdb_nmi is rather hacky and feels a bit odd to
enable. It is clearly intended to avoid almost all changes to the UART
driver. On our side we have been wondering whether the serial core can
add helpers to make it easy for a serial driver to implement an simple,
safe but not optimal NMI implementation. Making it easy to have
safety-first might make NMI more palatable.

Out-of-tree...

If, after looking at other approaches, we do all agree to nuke kgdb_nmi
then there shouldn't be much impediment (nor that many tears).
