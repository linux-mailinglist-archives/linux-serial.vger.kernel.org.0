 We do that already with the existing accessors, and while I agree the 
duplication is a bit unfortunate and could be solved with some macro 
hackery so that there is a single version in arch/alpha/include/asm/io.h 
that gets pasted to produce out-of-line copies in arch/alpha/kernel/io.c.  
That would be good having across all the accessors, but that is not 
relevant to the regression discussed here and therefore I do not request 
that you make such a clean-up as a part of this series.

 The whole point of this peculiar arrangement for cooked accessors is to 
avoid having barriers inserted inline around out-of-line calls to raw 
accessors, and therefore I maintain that we need to have the arrangement 
applied consistently across all the cooked accessors.  Since you're 
creating new distinct cooked accessors (by making their names no longer 
alias to existing cooked accessors), they need to follow the pattern.

 NB this arrangement was added back in 2.6.9-rc3, with:

ChangeSet@1.1939.5.8, 2004-09-22 22:40:06-07:00, rth@kanga.twiddle.home
  [ALPHA] Implement new ioread interface.

I believe.  I don't know if any further details or discussion around that 
can be chased, but Richard might be able to chime in.
