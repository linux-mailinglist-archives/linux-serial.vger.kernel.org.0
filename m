Subject: [PATCH] [PATCH v3] tty: fix a possible hang on tty device

We have met a hang on pty device, the reader was blocking
at epoll on master side, the writer was sleeping at wait_woken
inside n_tty_write on slave side, and the write buffer on
tty_port was full, we found that the reader and writer would
never be woken again and block forever.

The problem was caused by a race between reader and kworker:
n_tty_read(reader):  n_tty_receive_buf_common(kworker):
                    |room =3D N_TTY_BUF_SIZE - (ldata->read_head - tail)
                    |room <=3D 0
copy_from_read_buf()|
n_tty_kick_worker() |
                    |ldata->no_room =3D true

After writing to slave device, writer wakes up kworker to flush
data on tty_port to reader, and the kworker finds that reader
has no room to store data so room <=3D 0 is met. At this moment,
reader consumes all the data on reader buffer and call
n_tty_kick_worker to check ldata->no_room which is false and
reader quits reading. Then kworker sets ldata->no_room=3Dtrue
and quits too.

If write buffer is not full, writer will wake kworker to flush data
again after following writes, but if writer buffer is full and writer
goes to sleep, kworker will never be woken again and tty device is
blocked.

This problem can be solved with a check for read buffer size inside
n_tty_receive_buf_common, if read buffer is empty and ldata->no_room
is true, a call to n_tty_kick_worker is necessary to keep flushing
data to reader.

> Hi,

> This is the friendly patch-bot of Greg Kroah-Hartman.  You have sent him
> a patch that has triggered this response.  He used to manually respond
> to these common problems, but in order to save his sanity (he kept
> writing the same thing over and over, yet to different people), I was
> created.  Hopefully you will not take offence and will fix the problem
> in your patch and resubmit it so that it can be accepted into the Linux
> kernel tree.

> You are receiving this message because of the following common error(s)
> as indicated below:
>
> - Your patch is malformed (tabs converted to spaces, linewrapped, etc.)
>   and can not be applied.  Please read the file,
>   Documentation/email-clients.txt in order to fix this.
>
> - Your patch was attached, please place it inline so that it can be
>   applied directly from the email message itself.
>
> - You did not write a descriptive Subject: for the patch, allowing Greg,
>   and everyone else, to know what this patch is all about.  Please read
>   the section entitled "The canonical patch format" in the kernel file,
>   Documentation/SubmittingPatches for what a proper Subject: line should
>   look like.
>
> - It looks like you did not use your "real" name for the patch on either
>   the Signed-off-by: line, or the From: line (both of which have to
>   match).  Please read the kernel file, Documentation/SubmittingPatches
>   for how to do this correctly.
>
> - This looks like a new version of a previously submitted patch, but you
>   did not list below the --- line any changes from the previous version.
>   Please read the section entitled "The canonical patch format" in the
>   kernel file, Documentation/SubmittingPatches for what needs to be done
>   here to properly describe this.

> If you wish to discuss this problem further, or you have questions about
> how to resolve this issue, please feel free to respond to this email and
> Greg will reply once he has dug out from the pending patches received
