For this flush usecase, it is enough to support pause + read residue +
terminate which is supported according to the function comment for
pl330_pause().

> It doesn't look like it can ever set "DMA_PAUSED"

Why not? It pauses the transfer and is even able to allow reading the 
transferred byte count.

What it is claimed to not be able to do is resume. Note that w/o resume
serial8250_tx_dma() XON/XOFF processing will not work but that's 
unrelated to this issue (I'll probably need to do another patch to fix 
that on 8250 DMA side).

Maybe the patch below will help with pl330 DMA status (based on somewhat 
limited understanding of all the moving parts):


[PATCH] dmaengine: pl330: Set DMA_PAUSED when pausing

pl330_pause() does not set anything to indicate paused condition which
causes pl330_tx_status() to return DMA_IN_PROGRESS. This breaks 8250
DMA code after the fix in commit 57e9af7831dc ("serial: 8250_dma: Fix
DMA Rx rearm race"). The function comment for pl330_pause() claims
pause is supported but resume is not which is enough for 8250 DMA flush
to work as long as DMA status is reported correctly when appropriate.

Add PAUSED state for descriptor and mark BUSY descriptors with PAUSED
in pl330_pause(). Return DMA_PAUSED from pl330_tx_status() when the
descriptor is PAUSED.

Fixes: 88987d2c7534 ("dmaengine: pl330: add DMA_PAUSE feature")
