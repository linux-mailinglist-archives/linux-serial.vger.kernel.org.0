One is there to size the array (max you can have with a particular build
of a kernel ever). The other is to control the maximum number of ports per 
boot. I'd guess the former is there mainly for legacy reason from the era 
when memory really was scarser resource than it is today.

Why load the driver then at all, if there's no need/hw for it? Ironically, 
setting nr_uarts (as it is) to a smaller value would reduce that waste 
and in case of =0 the driver wouldn't be loaded.

I know distros will do it but that's their policy decision that doesn't 
really belong here. If there's hw/need for any users of a distro, they 
provide the support in the most generic way that makes things easy for 
them/users, that is, by having sufficient number of ports for (almost) all 
usecases.

In addition, to me n useless ports just sitting there doesn't sound that 
serious issue that it would warrant breaking setups that currently depend 
on certain ttyS numbers (I suppose you actually agree with this point).

I certainly suspect the built-in one really isn't there (in ACPI) but I 
don't want to spend my time on confirming the obvious.

Unfortunately, I don't know the answer to whether it is a safe assumption 
or not.

Again I don't follow the reasoning fully here. What is your end goal here 
in this scenario. You'd either want to have no ports to appear at all or 
have a non-discoverable (=bogus) port as ttyS0. Which way it is?

If you, on the other hand, would have a discoverable port that will take 
over ttyS0, I don't understand why it fails so it seemingly leaves only 
those two options I gave.

I'm not convinced there's something wrong with it. It's legacy yes, but
the max ports compiled in vs max ports per boot is not wrong/buggy as is.
