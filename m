I do not know for sure, I did not try to actively reproduce the issue on
another SoC. On the other hand the issue with the i.MX6ULL was noticed
during some testing, and we do exactly the same tests on other SoC and
there the issue is either not present or just happening very
infrequently.

Just open the uart console with a terminal application and copy/paste the
following:

 echo -n "12345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890" | wc

This is supposed to count 80 chars, you'll get less.

For doing that minicom is not a good choice since we noticed that it
introduces quite some delay between each chars, while using `screen` I
am able to reproduce the issue systematically. We initially reproduced
the issue using `ser2net` with the exact same test.
