So, sm501.c should not request resources for its children. This as simple as
that.

What you are trying to do here is a hack workaround on the current behaviour in
the Linux device model (resource management) as I told you already.

Because it's how it was designed. "One device per one resource". If you would
like to fix this, it should be done obviously not in 8250 driver or any other
driver, but driver core.

Nevertheless there is one particular exception here, i.e. IORESOURCE_MUXED.

Yes. Behaves in order how it's implementer. No issues here.

You have to check IORESOURCE_BUSY. It seems that what you missed in your
picture.

I didn't comment the rest until we will figure out the IO resource management
in general.
