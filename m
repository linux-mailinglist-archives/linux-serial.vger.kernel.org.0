This all depends on your uart hardware as well.

Why do you think that?

Are you sure this is possible with your hardware?  This depends on your
workload and lots of other things happening at the same time.  If you
need determinisitic behavior, have you tried the -RT kernel?

Have you used perf to measure where the delay is happening?
