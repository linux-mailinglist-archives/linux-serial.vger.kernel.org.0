Check drivers/tty/serial/amba-pl011.c code, there are quite many
controllers with 32-bit access, for instance ZTE UART and SBSA UART.

In other words this case is already well covered in the code, nothing
extraordinary is required or have to be invented here.

No, there is totally no need for this kind of a device tree property.

Instead please introduce a new compatible of your controller, just
like it's been done for the SBSA UART controller:

   compatible = "arm,sbsa-uart", "arm,pl011", "arm,primecell";

Then based on a match against your new compatible select a proper
configuration of the device driver, as I've said above similar cases
are already found in the code.
