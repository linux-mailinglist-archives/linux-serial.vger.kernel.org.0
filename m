When did I say "writing to random addresses" ? If you saw my suggestion, you
will find that "fuzzer will be able to test reading from random addresses,
writing to safe addresses (in order to find new lock dependency which would
otherwise be unnoticed)".

Disabling everything using kernel config option is overkill. What you are saying
is "never try to fuzz USB drivers" by excluding USB drivers from fuzz targets.
There is no need to disable whole tests. We need to exclude only stupid operations
(e.g. forever repeating SysRq-t) from fuzz targets.

No. security_locked_down() is not for fuzz kernels but for real kernels.

"enum lockdown_reason" is overkill, it just keeps fuzzers away from finding bugs.
For example, if ftrace code has bugs but ftrace_event_open() prevents from
fuzzing due to security_locked_down(LOCKDOWN_TRACEFS) ? Fuzz kernels should not
count on security_locked_down() returning errors. That is no different from
disabling everything using kernel config options.

My suggestion is not for real kernels but for fuzz kernels.
