I suppose there would need to be a mechanism to enable tracing by 
default (kernel cmd line?)  Is the UART driver even used very early in 
the boot process?

Not for 8250/16550?  Currently this feature only supports those and it 
also relies on the TSC which is an x86 thing.

Yes, we can return the string length from queue_remove() but we still 
need to call strlen() to accommodate all code paths.  The user might 
call read() with a very small buffer and that requires us to advance ptr 
past the beginning of the string on subsequent calls.

Done.

OK, I simplified this.

Done.

I can see your point.  If the user does want to reformat this it will be 
easier to start with the format you suggested.  Is this a general rule 
for kernel space?

Only the queue_xxx() functions read or write the queue structure.  The 
indices are reset below when we memset() the entire structure to 0.

I'll have to look into how difficult it would be to support other UARTs 
besides 8250/16550.

Fixed.

It didn't look like this field was used.  Was I wrong about this?

Done.

Done.

Thanks for looking at this.  I've created another patch that 
incorporates most of your suggestions.
