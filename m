Bisect wasn't an easy option as I'd applied a pile of patches after the interesting commits for our system to run.
I'm not a git master :)

So I just started reverting the patches that had been applied to the 8250 folder.
Worked backwards from head.

After reverting 57e9af7831dcf211c5c689c2a6f209f4abdf0bce
serial: 8250_dma: Fix DMA Rx rearm race

Things started to work again.

I reset everything and then just reverted that individual patch and things work.
So that looks like the culprit..
