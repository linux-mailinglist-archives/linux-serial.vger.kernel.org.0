I mean that I don't see a realistic way to apply your "Try running not
as root" suggestion.
We can drop root, but that will dramatic effect on lots of other
things that has nothing to do with serial console.

Precisely controlling what's being done is only possible in unit
testing setting. It's not that simple in a fuzzer setting. Precisely
restricting behavior of random programs is both (1) extremely complex,
(2) will over-restrict, read, make fuzzer less efficient, (3) still
most likely will be unreliable with lots of corner cases.
So I am looking for a more practical solution.
