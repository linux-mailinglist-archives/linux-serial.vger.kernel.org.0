Ack, I have no objection against the changes and if Maximilian is ok with
it I can merge these right away as an interim fix, but I would really
like to know why the serdev core / tty code is registering a serdev
device for a serial port before it is ready to have serdev_device_open()
called on it. To me it seems that the root cause is in somewhere in
the 8250_dw code or the serdev core code.

Resources sometimes not being ready is sometimes which drivers generally
speaking need to handle, but in this case the resource which is not
ready is the device the driver is binding to, so it seems that
the device is registered too soon.

If someone familiar with the serial / serdev code can provide some
insight here that would be great.

Regards,

Hans
