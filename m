I plan to submit them once the 5.7 merge window closes, I'll probably
have to go over them at least one more time to apply some polish.

On UARTs capable of disabling and enabling the receiver in software,
it's best to leverage that to enable full-duplex or half-duplex mode.
However after having a brief look at the DW UART databook, it seems
it's not capable of doing that.  For such UARTs, a separate GPIO indeed
seems like a legitimate approach to allow switching between full-duplex
and half-duplex.

"rs485-re-gpios" seems a bit cryptic, how about "rs485-rx-enable-gpios"
or "rs485-full-duplex-gpios"?

Thanks,

Lukas
