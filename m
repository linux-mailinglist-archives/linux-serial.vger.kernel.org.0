I honestly don't understand how to calculate the  baudrate, the following hack:

         switch (baud) {
           case 9601: { tcr = 4;  cpr = 32; quot = 406; } break;
           case 9602: { tcr = 8;  cpr = 16; quot = 406; } break;
           case 9603: { tcr = 16; cpr = 8;  quot = 406; } break; /* tcr will be masked to 0 */
         }
	*frac = (cpr << 8) | (tcr & OXSEMI_TORNADO_TCR_MASK);
         
I believed that they should give the same baudrate, but I get these baudrates:

9600 -> 10700   tcr = 9;  cpr = 9;  quot = 643;    /* Use standard calculations, not hack */
9601 -> 38400	tcr = 4;  cpr = 32; quot = 406;
9602 -> 19200	tcr = 8;  cpr = 16; quot = 406
9603 ->  9600	tcr = 16; cpr = 8;  quot = 406;
