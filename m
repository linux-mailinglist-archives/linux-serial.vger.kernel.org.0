I applied this patch to 672c0c5.  With the patch as supplied there was no
change: the first character was lost but all others were delivered as
expected.

I changed the second of the added "#if -0" directives to "#if 1" (thus
removing the LCR update).  This made things work: all characters were echoed
back to minicom as they were pressed.

As a final test I changed the first of the added "#if 1" directives to
"#if 0", effectively removing the extra register write you added earlier.
The resulting kernel still worked.  It appears that this extra register
write doesn't have any effect as far as the missing first character is
concerned.

On the basis of this, it seems the LCR update causes the loss of the first
character on version 0x27 hardware.
