This sort of thing could improve multi-line copy 'n paste (e.g. any case
where we issue more output than we receive in input) but be aware the pager
deliberately discards backlogged characters to improve latency so
in the use case that provoked this thread it makes no difference
whether the UART overflow machinery or the kdb core discards the backlog!
