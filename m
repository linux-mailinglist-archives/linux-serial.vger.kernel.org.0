>=20

Sorry, I haven't really read the thread but I'll quickly reply with
this.

Maybe option 4 is to make the uart driver a clk provider that consumes
the single reference clk like it is already doing today? Then when the
rate changes up above for the clk implemented here the clk set rate op
for the newly implemented clk can go poke the uart registers to maintain
the baud or whatever?

That is close to how the notifier design would work, but it avoids
keeping the notifiers around given that the notifiers are not preferred.
It is also closer to reality, the uart has a divider or mux internally
that we don't model as a clk, but we could just as easily model as such.
