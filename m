Sorry but I really don't see the issue. As of now DT abstractions
supports all my use-cases. If $another_developer has an USB device which
actually exposes multiple serial ports behind a single usb-interface,
fine. But in that case $another_developer needs to add the
support/extend the support for it if he wants to use it in combination
with serdev.

I actually have no such USB device and also my customer doesn't use such
a device. Therefore I'm afraid that I can't add support for something I
can't actually test.

What is your suggestion how the DT abstraction should look like in 2025,
e.g. given the current DT abstraction?

Okay, let me test this. Just that we're on the same page: The test is to
remove the serdev (bluetooth, gnss, ...) driver, right?

Okay, so you meant the TTY_PORT_KOPENED flag. According the
documentation of tty_kopen_exclusive():

| tty_kopen_exclusive - open a tty device for kernel

isn't that exactly what serdev-ttyport should do to "not share it with
user space"? IMHO it's an implementation detail if the logic behind
"open a tty device for kernel" is only built around a flag to suppress
the warning.
