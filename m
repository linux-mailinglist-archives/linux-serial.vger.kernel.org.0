If you make this a new line discipline, that is fine, as you can set
each tty device to have their own discipline.

But do not have options for that line discipline, on a module-basis,
that way will not work (think about multiple devices all using the same
line discipline.)

I do not know, let's see what you think would work and post that and we
can go from there.
