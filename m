No worries, whenever you get to spend more time with the Jensen and come
across issues with the serial ports, we can look into it.

I've just sent out an updated version of the patch which also applies
the Jensen quirk if a generic kernel is used.  It auto-detects at
runtime whether the kernel is running on a Jensen.  If on the other hand
the kernel is compiled specifically for the Jensen, the quirk is applied
unconditionally.

I've also realized that a code comment in sunsu.c refers to the Alpha
quirk, so I'm updating it to point to the new location.  It looks like
a JavaStation thin client of the same era had a similar hardware erratum
as the Jensen.

Thanks,

Lukas
