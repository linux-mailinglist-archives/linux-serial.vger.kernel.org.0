As per your instructions, I

* removed my fixes,
* built surface_aggregator into the kernal,
* built 8250_dw as a module and
* removed 8250_dw from initramfs as well,

and found the occurrence rate of the issue was around 30%.  With your
patch applied, the issue disappeared completely.

Really glad to see the final solution in serial core for this issue.=20
This might also help other serdev drivers.  Thank you all.

Best regards,
Weifeng
