The footer issues are fixed, but you should probably change the from:
and signed-off-by to your company address, right?

Why not put that paragraph in the changelog as well?

That's a horrible line to try to read now, right?

Why not turn it into a real if statement so we can make more sense of it
over time:

	u8 dir = 0x00;

	if ((pcidev->vendor == PCI_VENDOR_ID_EXAR) &&
	    (pcidev->subsystem_vendor != PCI_VENDOR_ID_SEALEVEL))
		dir = 0xff;

Looks better, right?

thanks,
