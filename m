Respectfully, this is an inadequate fix to a decade-old underlying issue
in the Xilinx device tree generator. The DTG assigns consecutive
"port-number" properties to UARTs handled by separate drivers (uartps,
uartlite, uartns), which are then used in drivers/tty/serial/uartlite.c
to index the struct uart_port[] array and set uart_port->line.
The DTG should number devices for each driver separately from 0;
serial_core.c checks for (0 <= uart_port->line < NR_UART_PORTS). As a
consequence, when a Zynq system has both a PS-UART and a Uartlite,
setting SERIAL_UARTLITE_NR_UARTS explicitly to 1 in Kconfig means
probing the uartlite fails, which is confusing to the unsuspecting
KConfig user. Setting the default to 16 just kicks the can down the
road because it will fail for more than 15 Uartlites (or less, if there
are more PS-UARTs or AXI 16550A UARTs).
I've submitted a patch for the DTG numbering scheme to git@xilinx.com
just yesterday. Will post a PATCH to this list later today or tomorrow
to handle the issue from the other end (uartlite.c).

Cheers,
Ruediger
