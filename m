Your idea sounds interesting. I think where we are reaching is to have
an ever active listener to serial port that can be scheduled to any
random active CPU. And to keep its CPU overhead negligible, it can
sleep and only wake-up and listen once every 500 ms or 1 second
(configurable).

I will try to think more about it and probably give it a try with a PoC.
