Then perhaps it's not really ever going to happen if no one actually
does the work and wants their distro to change to not have it.

Again, that's a distro's policy decision to make, don't force the kernel
to support a wishy-washy distro's decision :)

Agreed, this is a policy decision a distro needs to make.

Again, policy decision that a distro needs to make.

Please define "long time" given that no distro has even done this yet?
