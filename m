Certainly none of the devices with a read() method have an exit().

I tested on qemu/x86-64 (8250) and qemu/arm64 (pl011). In both cases it
works well.

Yes, I'll add that.

That's what I thought, yes. Although it might be best to handle that
by ripping it out of the original patch set.

That's not a prize I was especially anxious to win...

However the results seem quite pleasing from a user point of view:
*if* we hit a breakpoint then the system really will be leaving no
stone unturned in its attempt to have talk (and listen) to the user.

If we want things to avoid hacking at the console structure  we could
provide a direct function call API from earlycon to kgdboc so we limit
earlycon_kgdboc so it can *only* attach to the earlycon (and either
defer the exit() or leave a comment in earlycon so that if exit() were
ever added it doesn't break kgdboc).


Daniel.
