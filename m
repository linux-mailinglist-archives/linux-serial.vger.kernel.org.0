Thanks, I'll take a look at this. I had a nagging feeling I must be
missing something when I gave up and wrote the hack found in this
patch. Sounds like I should have paid that feeling closer attention!

Will do.

Very likely. I have a note to test this as a module but was curious
whether having kgdb_earlycon_late_init() was the right approach
anyway.

This is just matching styles with the rest of the file (like the
extern). Maybe I'll put polishing the header a little on my TODO
list.

Ah...

When I rebased this patch on your most recent patchset I did most of the
fix ups during the merge. The final few problems I caught *after* the
merge and it looks like I neglected to commit them. Sorry... and I'm
just relieved you didn't try and compile test this patch!

It is done this way to prevent kgdb_arch_late() being called twice
(because I don't want to have to mandate that kgdb_arch_late() is
idempotent on every architecture).

However I guess a simple alternative would be to call
kgdb_earlycon_late_init() *before* setting dbg_is_early to false.

Anyhow, I hope you early review comments mean this issue can become
irrelevant anyway!
