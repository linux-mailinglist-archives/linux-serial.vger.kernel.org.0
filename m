Ah, but look at how the ->handle_rx() call works.  Specifically let's
look at handle_rx_console().  It takes in a count and just reads
everything without referring back to RX_LAST and RX_LAST_BYTE_VALID.
If your model was the one geni was actually using then wouldn't that
call need to be re-checking RX_LAST and RX_LAST_BYTE_VALID for each
FIFO entry?  You can see that as it's reading from the FIFO it reads
all whole words first and then only reads a partial word for the very
last word in the packet.

No.  RX_LAST simply means "the last FIFO entry you read out will be
partial".  So if:

RX_FIFO_WC = 2
RX_LAST = 1
RX_LAST_BYTE_VALID = 2

Then it's important to realize that if you read one FIFO element that
it will be a full word big.  RX_LAST only applies to the last element.

Hopefully reading through handle_rx_console() and seeing that it never
looks at RX_LAST clarifies?
