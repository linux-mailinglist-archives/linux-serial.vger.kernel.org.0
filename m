Can you try the patch below?  I just sent it to Linus and it's from Tony
to resolve some other pm issues with the serial port code.

Subject: [PATCH 3/4] serial: core: Fix checks for tx runtime PM state

Maximilian reported that surface_serial_hub serdev tx does not work during
system suspend. During system suspend, runtime PM gets disabled in
__device_suspend_late(), and tx is unable to wake-up the serial core port
device that we use to check if tx is safe to start. Johan summarized the
regression noting that serdev tx no longer always works as earlier when the
serdev device is runtime PM active.

The serdev device and the serial core controller devices are siblings of
the serial port hardware device. The runtime PM usage count from serdev
device does not propagate to the serial core device siblings, it only
propagates to the parent.

In addition to the tx issue for suspend, testing for the serial core port
device can cause an unnecessary delay in enabling tx while waiting for the
serial core port device to wake-up. The serial core port device wake-up is
only needed to flush pending tx when the serial port hardware device was
in runtime PM suspended state.

To fix the regression, we need to check the runtime PM state of the parent
serial port hardware device for tx instead of the serial core port device.

As the serial port device drivers may or may not implement runtime PM, we
need to also add a check for pm_runtime_enabled().
