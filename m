The bug was introduced in the pre-git era, so I can't provide a Fixes tag:

https://git.kernel.org/tglx/history/c/befff6f5bf5f

This commit, which went into v2.6.10, added an unconditional
uart_remove_one_port() in serial8250_register_port().

In 2012, commit 835d844d1a28 ("8250_pnp: do pnp probe before legacy probe")
made the call to uart_remove_one_port() conditional on uart->port.dev
being non-NULL and that allows me to fix the issue by setting that
pointer to NULL in the error path.  The commit went into v3.7, so it
should be possible to fix the problem going back to v3.7 with my patch.
And before that one needs to additionally make the call to
uart_remove_one_port() conditional.

However, according to www.kernel.org the oldest LTS kernel is v3.16.
So I've given you the nitty-gritty details but it's all fairly
irrelevant and the Cc: stable tag I've put into the commit seems the
best I can do in this case.

As for your other comment:

Sure, I can change that.

Thanks!
