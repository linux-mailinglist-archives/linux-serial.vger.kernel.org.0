So the same device is used for boot console as well as a ttyACM device
later on?

What tool does that?  Why not fix that?

Then don't have boot print to that device :)

But what is supposed to happen to the data that was sent to it while it
was "closed"?

I strongly just suggest having userspace not write to the device to
start with, that would solve this, right?
