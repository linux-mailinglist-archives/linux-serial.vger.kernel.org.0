Hi there,

Notice that by no means I am an expert either on the TTY or CAN subsystems.

Do you mean the electric wire-level or Rx buffer threshold?

From what I read I believe you are talking about the FIFO threshold.
One approach Is adding a new function to serdev_controller_ops for
supported (and tested) controllers, I think.

As Greg said, it is easier to organize the work in a series of patches
and send them for review.
