With "won't work" you mean, that the GPIO can't be used for modem
control in this case in the current implementation (with this
patchset)? Or do you mean, that the breakage (input does not work
on Broxton systems) will not be solved by this patch?

If its the former, then I think that solving this issue is something
for a new patch, to support modem-control on such platforms as well
(if needed).

Please note that this patch is not trying to get modem-control working
on such ACPI based systems. Its targeted for device-tree enabled
platforms, using the 8250 serial driver, here specifically a MIPS
MT7688 based board. And just wants to fix the latter issue mentioned
above so that the 8250 modem-control support can be accepted in
mainline.
