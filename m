So I guess the two options to avoid the overhead are:

1. Create a new struct:

struct nmi_queuable_work_struct {
  struct work_struct work;
  struct irq_work iw;
};

Then the overhead is only needed for those that want this
functionality.  Those people would need to use a variant
nmi_schedule_work() which, depending on in_nmi(), would either
schedule it directly or use the extra work.

Looks like Daniel already responded and suggested this.


2. Something that duplicates the code of at least part of irq_work and
therefore saves the need to store the function pointer.  Think of it
this way: if you made a whole copy of irq_work that was hardcoded to
just call the function you wanted then you wouldn't need to store a
function pointer.  This is, of course, excessive.  I was trying to
figure out if you could do less by only copying the NMI-safe
linked-list manipulation, but this is probably impossible and not
worth it anyway.
