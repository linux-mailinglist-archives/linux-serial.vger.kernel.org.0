Please no. We really would like to get rid of that ugly hack. The BOTHER exists
for ages.

Is it possible to reduce a commit message by shifting some stuff to the
dedicated documentation?

Can we, please, split the quirk driver first as it's done in a lot of examples
(_exar, _mid, _lpss, _...) and then modify it?
