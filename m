Through DT, yes (or ACPI equivalent).

Is this "Auto" thing done with some dip switches/jumpers and is cast to=20
stone after hw init? So driver's .probe() could just read that state
and adjust kernel rs485 state based one it?

Once the serial line has been transitioned into RS485 mode, userspace does=
=20
not need to be aware of it (which can happen through DT so no userspace=20
involvement). So this shouldn't be seen as a problem.

I don't think such mechanism exists beyond DT currently, but I don't see=20
why it could be added.
