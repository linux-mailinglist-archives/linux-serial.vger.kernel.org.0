First, please fix your patch Subject which is way too verbose. You
should aim at less than 72 chars including prefix. Something like

	"vt: keyboard: suppress smatch warning in vt_do_kdgkb_ioctl"

should do.

Not sure how far we want to take the suppression of false-positive
warnings but at least this isn't the right way to do it.

Instead, move the kfree() into the two cases blocks and initialise ret
to 0 as is done in several other vt helpers in case a driver bug ever
causes them to be called for the wrong cmds (e.g. instead of sprinkling
WARN_ON(1) in all those functions).

You may want to mention that the kfree warning was introduced by 

	07edff926520 ("vt: keyboard, reorder user buffer handling in vt_do_kdgkb_ioctl")

which moved the shared allocation into the switch statement, and perhaps
also mention

	4e1404a5cd04 ("vt: keyboard, extract and simplify vt_kdskbsent")

for the ret warning.
