For the record, there were plenty of =1/6 and a few =224/31.

It would be kind of interesting to know if handle_rx_dma() would never 
call up->dma->rx_dma(up) but return true instead to see if non-DMA Rx gets
a corrupted byte too in the very same scenario (it's not the same test as 
your no DMA test you did initially because only DMA Rx gets disabled so it
hopefully hits the same timing, etc. by keeping DMA Tx on).

Yes, it's certainly is a corruption which shouldn't occur.

I was contemplating whether to apply the fix to all 8250 or just add 
HW specific UART_BUG_xx for this. In the end (especially while looking 
into these most recent debug logs) I think it's generally useful to _not_ 
start DMA on UART_IIR_THRI because it's impossible to make an informed 
decision with it whether to do DMA or not.

I've just sent the cleaned up fix patch out.

Thanks a lot for testing.
