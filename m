Apologies, the tool I've used to send the patches (U-Boot's patman)
Cc-ed the scripts/get_maintainer.pl output per-patch, instead of
per-series as I had assumed it would. This was the first time I tried
it, I'll keep that in mind.

Here are links to all four emails:

Or I can resend the last two patches to you, or resend all the parts to
everyone again.

I was trying to boot a Debian userspace with cryptsetup, with the kernel
command line:

	root=/dev/mapper/sda3_crypt quiet splash

The Debian initramfs handles most of the work (the password prompt,
device mounts, etc.).

When I used the same kernel/initramfs/rootfs on a QEMU aarch64 VM, it
only prompted on the serial console instead the framebuffer. I'm
assuming the same thing happens on my hardware as well.

I can also ask the Debian initramfs to launch a shell by adding "break"
to the command line, which won't be printed on my device's screen unless
I also add "console=tty0". That shell also only appears on the serial
console on the QEMU aarch64 VM, unless I again add "console=tty0".

This is my primary computer and I'd prefer not dismantling it, so my
findings above are the best I believe I can do to confirm it now. I'm 
hoping other people would be interested in this, and would test more 
than I can.

Plymouth is a userspace program that's famous for showing a splash
animation during boot, but in this context: it handles user-interaction
that might need to happen while the initramfs is running, by printing
messages and prompts and reading user input to/from all consoles.

As in "When the device has no SPCR _and_ no chosen stdout-path".

I'm saying that from a userspace perspective, and the patches explicitly
try to switch to the vt only after a real framebuffer is initialized. So
if I did it right, it would still use SPCR/stdout-path's console during
the early stages. (I admit I haven't adjusted to talking within a kernel 
context yet).

In all honesty, I'm not sure if this is even considered a kernel bug,
let alone my patches a correct solution; hence the RFC PATCH as an
attempt at demonstrating this can be "fixed" in kernel.

> Maybe you should figure out the real root cause?

Thanks for the reply. Any ideas on what else could be causing this 
behaviour?
