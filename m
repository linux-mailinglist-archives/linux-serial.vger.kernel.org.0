Chester seemingly did: "all 'fsl' ... as well", not "all new 'fsl'"
ones, in the patch context of existing fsl.yaml. Like I said, it may
just have been unluckily worded.

Therefore my saying that it does contain tons of non-new SoC/platform
bindings that he's not allowed to break by changing them.

Nobody is suggesting new S32G ABI be compatible with downstream BSPs.
These patches and changes we're discussing already differ from the BSP.

My point was that as soon as we merge S32G into mainline, it will become
ABI and shouldn't be changed incompatibly anymore once in a release.

These automotive platforms don't run off-the-shelf distros yet and will
need to get their bootloaders upstreamed, too. In particular we'll need
mainline TF-A to merge the SCMI implementation before we can rely on it
here in the kernel for a clk driver; that's holding up MMC and Ethernet.

Best regards,
Andreas
