There are some more patches in the pipeline for the next cycle
to add support for an rs485 bus termination GPIO.  They're on
the tip of this branch:

https://github.com/RevolutionPi/linux/commits/revpi-4.19

Just so you know in advance and duplicate work is avoided.

Some UARTs allow disabling the receiver, this can be taken advantage of
to implement half-duplex mode.  It's what I did in 8250_bcm2835aux.c.

On the Revolution Pi devices, !RE is usually connected to ground, so
reception is always enabled and it cannot be disabled in software
except by turning off the UART receiver.

There are also boards out there which connect !RE to RTS.  Then only
half-duplex mode is supported by the hardware and there's no way for
software to work around it.

Thanks,

Lukas
