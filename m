Subject: [PATCH 3/3 v2] tty: reorganize tty & serial menus
Date:   Wed, 11 Mar 2020 15:57:36 -0700

Move LDISC_AUTOLOAD ahead of the Serial drivers menu.

Move the Serial drivers menu ahead of the Non-standard serial port
support menu.

Move NOZOMI out of the SERIAL_NONSTANDARD area since it does not
depend on SERIAL_NONSTANDARD and it breaks the SERIAL_NONSTANDARD
menu list.

Alphabetize the remaining drivers (in tty/Kconfig) by their prompt strings.
[The drivers in tty/hvc/Kconfig and tty/serial/Kconfig have not
been alphabetized.]
