This (local) interrupts disabling might be not a big problem on SMP, I
dunno, as another core could still handle IRQs, but for non-SMP case
this is too bad as it causes missed data on other ports.

Can we disable this locking on non-SMP configs as a work-around?

Unfortunately, this is entirely impractical for an application that
utilizes maximum baud rates on other serial ports.
