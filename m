Hi Niklas,

 I've skimmed over and I agree, though I'd place some of the #ifdefs 
differently, e.g. above #define QPCR_TEST_FOR1.  Overall I think it would 
make sense to reorder code and group stuff that depends on port I/O such 
as to minimise the number of #ifdefs.

 Ideally we could come with a slightly user-friendlier change that would 
report the inability to handle port I/O devices as they are discovered 
rather than just silently ignoring them.

 I think we need to get this right regardless.  And also while I run a 
generic distribution kernel on my POWER9 as a production system, I'd love 
to see an option to build a tailored configuration that would indeed 
remove support for port I/O from the kernel side for systems like mine 
that have no provision for port I/O in hardware, knowing that such a 
kernel will only ever run on such hardware and discarding compiled code 
that won't ever be used.
