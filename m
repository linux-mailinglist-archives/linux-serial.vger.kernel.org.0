To enable core infrastructure or quirks for a certain SoC or SoC family,
and to have a symbol for individual drivers to depend on?
To make it easier to configure a kernel suited for a specific system?
Mostly, you can take arm64/defconfig, disable the ARCH_* guards
for SoC families you're not interested in, and have a suitable kernel
for your system.

E.g. by looking at which .dtsi files contain device nodes that have a
compatible value that matches the list of compatible values in the
driver.  Most IP cores are only present on a fairly limited set of SoCs
and SoC families. Designware IPs are the major exception.
And I hope the driver author/maintainer has some knowledge here.

Let's repeat your question above: "How do they know that...?".
I guess the driver developer knows better (read: needs much less
investigation time) than the distro config owner.

It's not just for distros.  If we can make life easier for every single
developer or user who configures a kernel, by just storing that
information in the dependency system, I think that's a justification
for doing that.  And in fact we're already doing that in most
subsystems. Serial seems to be the only one that wants to move
in the other direction...
