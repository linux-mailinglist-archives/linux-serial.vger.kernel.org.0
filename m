So I gave it a try on my platform (R-Car), with just the serial driver
builtin.  I can see the kernel booting using earlycon.
However, the serial driver is never probed, as the pin control driver is
missing. And after that, it would need the clock domain (power domain
and clock drivers), and more serial clock inputs (clock driver, again).
Fortunately DMA is optional (dmac driver, and optional iommu driver).

I guess core platform-specific drivers can be loaded from the initramfs,
after which the serial driver would be probed, finally.  If the
initramfs includes a storage driver, anything else can be loaded from
e.g. eMMC.

Care must be taken, as probe deferral behaves differently after
late_initcall time (see driver_deferred_probe_check_state_continue),
which may cause issues with "optional" components like DMA controllers
and IOMMUs.  Unused clocks and power domains are not turned off,
unlike for the builtin case.

On some SoCs, even the interrupt controller (GIC) may be part of a clock
and/or power domain, while the GIC driver is not aware of that.
For the clock, that is handled by CLK_IS_CRITICAL in the clock driver.
For power domains, that is not handled explicitly on Renesas SoCs, as
the GIC is always in the same power domain as other devices that are
Runtime PM-aware.  But if those devices would have modular drivers, that
power domain could still be turned off.

So on a modern ARM system, I assume a generic kernel with no
vendor-specific drivers builtin can indeed work.
On older systems, without an ARM architectured timer, you will need at
least the platform-specific timer driver (and the clock driver) builtin.
Assumed the timer's power domain has been powered up by the firmware.

Thanks, hadn't seen that presentation.
It matches my understanding.
