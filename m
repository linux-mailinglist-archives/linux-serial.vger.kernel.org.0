I have found the chapter about I/O in the Alpha reference manual, in the 
section "5.6.4.7 Implications for Memory Mapped I/O", it says:

To reliably communicate shared data from a processor to an I/O device:
1. Write the shared data to a memory-like physical memory region on the 
processor.
2. Execute an MB instruction.
3. Write a flag (equivalently, send an interrupt or write a register 
location implemented in the I/O device).

The receiving I/O device must:
1. Read the flag (equivalently, detect the interrupt or detect the write 
to the register location implemented in the I/O device).
2. Execute the equivalent of an MB.
3. Read the shared data.

So, we must use MB, not WMB when ordering I/O accesses.

The WMB instruction specification says that it orders writes to 
memory-like locations with other writes to memory-like locations. And 
writes to non-memory-like locations with other writes to non-memory-like 
locations. But it doesn't order memory-like writes with I/O-like writes.

The section 5.6.3 claims that there are no implied barriers.



So, if we want to support the specifications:

read*_relaxed and write*_relaxed need at least one barrier before or after 
(memory-barriers.txt says that they must be ordered with each other, the 
alpha specification doesn't specify ordering).

read and write - read must have a barrier after it, write before it. There 
must be one more barrier before a read or after a write, to make sure that 
there is barrier between write+read.
