Right, I remember that discussion. :)

I guess we can always retrofit that selection option if anyone needs it.
Generally if hardware RS485 support is available, one doesn't want to
use software emulation.

stm32-usart.c originally only had hardware-driven Driver Enable and
software emulation was added afterwards because the RTS pin is
sometimes pinmuxed to some other function.  But such use cases are
probably rare.

Thanks,

Lukas
