The MFD driver is not doing anything on behalf of the child.  Being the
parent (MFD), it is requesting the memory region of the MFD/parent
device, using pci_request_regions(), similar to how it is done in
fx. janz-cmodio.c.

Linux device resource model supports a parent/child/sibling
structure, specifically to allow for doing something like this.
Requesting memory resources are not restricted to use the iomem_resource
root.

For example, drivers/pcmcia/soc_common.c:soc_pcmcia_add_one()

	ret = request_resource(&iomem_resource, &skt->res_skt);
	if (ret)
		goto out_err_1;

	ret = request_resource(&skt->res_skt, &skt->res_io);
	if (ret)
		goto out_err_2;

As an example of a parent/child memory resource request.

The problem is that the 8250 driver only allows for requesting memory
region from the root (iomem_resource), as it uses a single
resource_size_t mapbase value for specifying the memory resource instead
of a full struct resource, which would allow passing in a parent.

So maybe we should go down that direction intead, extending 8250 driver
to replace mapbase with a resource struct instead?

I am aware of that (sm501.c).  It avoids the problem by not requesting
the parent memory region (sm->io_res), and requesting all child memory
regions directly in root instead of relative to the sm->io_res parent.

But as resoure management is designed for managing a parent/child
resource tree, this looks much more like a workaround than the right
solution.

No, I actually try to do the right thing in relation to Linux device
resource model.  But 8250 is just not behaving very well in that
respect, not having been made really aware of the resource model.

And sm501.c MFD driver ignores the way resource model is designed, and
just make things work.
