OK. To me it seems uart.port.port_id should be always 0 in exar_pci_probe()
and get automatically allocated in serial_base_port_add(). Sounds like this
is not a duplicate port_id issue though but something else as it sounds
like you're not getting duplicate sysfs entry related errors.

If it is a port_id conflict I'm not sure why commit 3d9e6f556e23 is not
working for your as it has commit a4a79e03bab5 ("serial: core: Revert
port_id use"). Care to check that again, or maybe try with v6.5 with just
the commit below reverted?

04c7f60ca477 ("serial: core: Fix serial core port id, including multiport devices")

Dmesg output might help also to figure out if this happens on the first
port or the second port.

Not sure yet where the -22 error here comes from.

Tony
