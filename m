No, that latter case is as I understand it usually called "4-wire
rs485", while rs-422 is an entirely different animal, and the wiring is
in some sense actually closer to rs-232. rs-422 is full-duplex, with all
the slave device's tx-lines connected to the master's rx, and the
master's tx connected to the slaves' rx (ok, it uses differential
signalling, so there are four wires involved and not two as in rs-232).
But I'm no expert, and there doesn't seem to be entirely consistent
terminology.

I don't see Crescent introducing any new gpio that needs to be handled.
In fact, I can't even see why from the perspective of the software that
rs422 isn't just rs232; there's no transmit enable pin that needs to be
handled. But maybe the uart driver does something different in rs422
mode; I assume he must have some update of some driver, since otherwise
the new rs422 bit should be rejected by the core. So I can't really see
the whole picture of that rs422 story.

Indeed, I wasn't really able to come up with a good description. Thanks,
that's much better.
