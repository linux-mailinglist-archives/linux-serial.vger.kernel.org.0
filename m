Subject: Re: [EXT] [PATCH] serial: 8250_pci: Avoid irq sharing for MSI(-X) interrupts.

Btw., one question to the experts, after much more grepping through
the irq handling code and being no wiser than before:

My understanding of MSI(-X) is that one of the big advantages over
legacy IRQ is that there are so many available MSI IRQ's, and so IRQ
sharing is normally not needed. So why did the driver choose an MSI
irq shared with the USB host controller? Or iow., why did

pci_alloc_irq_vectors(dev, 1, 1, PCI_IRQ_ALL_TYPES); and uart.port.irq
= pci_irq_vector(dev, 0); return a IRQ number that was already in use
at that time? Is this something to be expected, or some quirk specific
to serial drivers or this hw?

Thanks and have a nice weekend,
-mario
