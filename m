Subject: [PATCH 0/7] Apple SoC PMGR device power states driver
Date:   Wed,  6 Oct 2021 00:59:16 +0900
Message-Id: <20211005155923.173399-1-marcan@marcan.st>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.33.0

This series adds the driver for the Apple PMGR device power state
registers. These registers can clockgate and (in some cases) powergate
specific SoC blocks. They also control the reset line, and can have
additional features such as automatic power management.

The current driver supports only the lowest/highest power states,
provided via the genpd framework, plus reset support provided via
the reset subsystem.

Apple's PMGRs (there are two in the T8103) have a uniform register
bit layout (sometimes with varying features). To be able to support
multiple SoC generations as well as express pd relationships
dynamically, this binding describes each PMGR power state control
as a single devicetree node. Future SoC generations are expected to
retain backwards compatibility, allowing this driver to work on them
with only DT changes.

#1-#2: Adds the required device tree bindings
#3: The driver itself.
#4: Somewhat unrelated DT change, but I wanted to get it out of the way
    for #7
#5: Instantiates the driver in t8103.dtsi.
#6: Adds runtime-pm support to the Samsung UART driver, as a first
    consumer.
#7: Instantiates a second UART, to more easily test this.

There are currently no consumers for the reset functionality, so
it is untested, but we will be testing it soon with the NVMe driver
(as it is required to allow driver re-binding to work properly).
