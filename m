Hi Andy,

I'm not sure whether this qualifies as a "bug fix" or not,
since the proper way to handle it was introduced after the "bad" commit,
and the "bad" commit happens to still work fine for anyone running the
standard 115200 baud or higher.

For that matter, I'm not even sure if this affects other hardware,
I'm only able to test this on a MIPS SOC, and I wonder if anyone can
reproduce it on something else.

If that level of accuracy doesn't matter for tags, then yes I suppose
it should be tagged as "Fixes".

Again, I'm not sure which is better for performance, between adding
a conditional check or doing the math for every case.
The 10 ms timeout has been there since the beginning of the git history,
so clearly it is enough for single-frame transfers at any baud.
The new function uart_fifo_timeout() provides a variable timeout, but start=
ing out
with an arbitrary 20 ms as a minimum, which I think can be traced back
to some hardware-specific workaround... but definitely much more
than what's needed for most cases (115200 baud needs at least ~1.5 ms).

I'd let you all decide, and I can adjust the patch if needed.
