I know support for serial_rs485 is not very common, but the documentation 
for serial_rs485 explicitly mentions the 16C950 UART, which is the UART 
used by the serial card under test.

The datasheet for the 16C950 indeed does not mention "RS485 Auto-Enable", 
but it does say that the DTR pin may be programmed to automatically turn 
the transmitter on and off. See "485_EN" on Page 10 and "ACR[4:3]: DTR# 
line configuration" on page 36 of the manual. 
(https://www.semiconductorstore.com/pdf/newsite/oxford/ox16c950b.pdf)

It doesn't use the same terminology, but it is my understanding that the 
functionality of these registers is sufficient for the 16C950 to support 
RS485 Auto-Enable.

Additionally, the Windows driver for this card supports RS485 Auto-Enable.
