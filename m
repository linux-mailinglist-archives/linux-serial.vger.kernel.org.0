There's a typo there: "modelled" -> "modeled"

-

I suspect you didn't try to build it with Sphinx [1]. The html output of the
above would be:

	"1. Using device tree: The card is modelled as a node with zero or more child nodes each representing a virtual tty device. To create a device simply define a child node with the required device parameters. This is explained in detail in DT binding file: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/serial/ttyvs.yaml"

(E.g. everything on a single line).


[1] To build, just use:
		make htmldocs

    it will likely point you some packages to install, in order to be
    able to generate both html and pdf outputs. After installing them,
    run "make htmldocs" again. The output should be under:

	Documentation/output/admin-guide/virtual-tty-ttyvs.html


For Sphinx, a paragraph requires an extra blank line. So, the
above should be written, instead, as:

	1. Using device tree:

	The card is modeled as a node with zero or more child nodes each
	representing a virtual tty device. To create a device simply define
	a child node with the required device parameters. This is explained
	in detail in DT binding file:

	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/serial/ttyvs.yaml

Personally, I would make it look a little nicer writing it instead as:

	1. Using device tree
	--------------------

	The card is modeled as a node with zero or more child nodes each
	representing a virtual tty device. To create a device simply define
	a child node with the required device parameters. This is explained
	in detail in DT binding file:

	- Documentation/devicetree/bindings/serial/ttyvs.yaml

Same as above.

As Randy suggested, use a table here, like:

Pin mappings are bit maps:

	===  =========================================
	bit  meaning
	===  =========================================
	0    connect a pin to CTS pin
...
	3    connect to RI
	===  =========================================

You need to add spaces (or tabs) at the lines under the code-block,
as otherwise Sphinx will ignore it (and place everything on a single
line).

Hmm... the code below is not shell script. Btw, I would use, instead, "::"
notation:

	An example to create a standard null modem pair with device numbers
	0 and 1 with pin numbers as per RS232 standards will be something
	like this::

		/dev/ttyvs0        /dev/ttyvs1
...

Ok, the above is a shell code block, but it is not part of the 
ASCII artwork. So, it deserves its own code block.

While not mandatory, I would use this for constants:

	``CONFIG_CONFIGFS_FS=y``

(this changes the font to monotonic).

On the documents I write myself, I use this for variables, paths, modprobe
parameters, config options, inlined code snippets, etc.

A side effect is that several text editors (emacs, pico, vim, kate, ...) that
will highlight those in-lined code blocks with a different color, with helps 
a lot, even when looking on them as plain texts.

You need to properly indent lists:

	1. Emulating framing error: the driver inserts -7 in data buffer as
	   the byte that got corrupted due to framing error while receiving data.
	   To emulate this write 1 to /sys/class/tty/ttyvsN/event file.
