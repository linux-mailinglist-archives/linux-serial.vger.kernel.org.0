So all code that use/support platform_get_resource() is legacy code?

commit 7945f929f1a77a1c8887a97ca07f87626858ff42

    drivers: provide devm_platform_ioremap_resource()
    
    There are currently 1200+ instances of using platform_get_resource()
    and devm_ioremap_resource() together in the kernel tree.
    
    This patch wraps these two calls in a single helper. Thanks to that
    we don't have to declare a local variable for struct resource * and can
    omit the redundant argument for resource type. We also have one
    function call less.

When do you expect arch/x86 to be converted to device tree?

I don't have hardware so I can test it, but I assume that it is
working.

It is ignoring framework code (mfd-core), that is implemented to await
re-inventing the wheel for each and every mfd driver.  If that is an
issue, then yes, sm501.c does have an issue and could be improved/fixed.

I fear we are coming to an end here.

I don't seem to be able to break through to you, to get you to
understand the issue here.

I want to write a simple and elegant mfd driver, using mfd-core
framework (the mfd_add_devices() function call to be specific).  I don't
want to reimplement similar functionality in the mfd driver.

The other drivers I need all work fine with this, but serial8250 does
not.

As I understand Lee Jones, he seem to agree with me, so could you
please, please consider that I might not be totally on crack, and might
actually have brough forward a valid proposition.

We are on repeat here.  I don't agree with you here.  I have a simple
generic 8250 (16550A) compatible device, and cannot use it in a mfd
driver using the standard mfd-core framework.

The lacking of support for platform_get_resource() in the generic
serial8250 driver is not a feature.  It should be supported, just as it
is in several of the specialized 8250 drivers.

On repeat again.  I have explained it way to many times, so I guess I
must assume by now that you do not think that being able to use
serial8250 together with mfd-core is something that should be solved.

Exactly. I am pretty sure I have said this more than once in this
thread.  This IP is perfectly standard.  It would be completely wrong to
write a specialized 8250 driver for this.

But if I fail to find a way to get something merged which allows using
the generic serial8250 driver with platform_get_resource(), I guess I
need to handle this out-of-tree.  And anybody else needing/wanting to do
the same would have to do that as well.

It would still mean that I would have revert to not using convenient and
otherwise fully appropriate API calls like pci_request_regions() and
mfd_add_devices().

The mfd driver in question is for a PCI device.  Not being able to
request the PCI regions seems silly.

Not being able to register all child devices with the call introduced
for that sole purpose also seems silly.
