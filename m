I have designed this change and it didn't go to vendor tree first.
I have been also asking if this is the right way to go.
You can find the whole series started with this RFC
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/e2039dc5-92ec-d3a1-bc4f-6565a8c901ac@suse.de/t/

https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/6/6/346
and then

https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/9/3/404


And even this step was discussed before in
[RFC PATCH 0/4] serial: uartps: Dynamic allocation
which was July 2017.

And all these patches have been merged by Greg and then I have taken
them back to Xilinx Linux tree.

And the same concept was also applied to uartlite and intention is also
to apply it to pl011 driver to avoid this warning.
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/tty/serial/amba-pl011.c?h=v5.2-rc1#n2538

I have followed standard process and I have been asking for advices how
to do it without hardcoded any number and limiting amount of
pre-registered uarts because adding Kconfig options for NR_UARTs was
NACK in past too.
If you know better way how this can be done, please let us know.

And if there is bug we should definitely fix it.

Series have been applied by Great 2018-09-18. Feel free to check log here:

Similar changes have been sent for uartlite but they should use the same
concept as I started to use for uartps.
But based on what I see in linux-next these patches haven't been merged
there.
That's why I don't understand the reason for this patch.

If you want to see latest state of uartlite you can find it out here.
