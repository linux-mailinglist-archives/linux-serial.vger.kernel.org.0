It no longer happens. Johan's recent patches fixed it. Quick history:

1. Pre-kfifo, we used to output stale characters (ones that had been
dropped) in the FIFO underrun case. Nobody noticed for years.

2. After kfifo we got a hard lockup.

3. Johan's early patches to fix the hard lockup caused us to output
'\0' characters upon FIFO underrun. It was not obvious that the '\0'
characters were being output. To make it easier to debug / see, both
he and I locally made it output some other character which was more
obvious.

4. Johan fixed the FIFO underrun.

5. Johan added a patch such that if we ever get another FIFO underrun
in the future we'll output '\0' characters in the FIFO instead of
getting a hard lockup.

If we're really confident that we can't get a FIFO underun we could
just revert commit 2ac33975abda ("serial: qcom-geni: do not kill the
machine on fifo underrun") and we'll get a hard lockup if we ever
underrun. IMO, though, it's better to output _something_ in this case
to make it more obvious. If you hate this patch, though, fine. Let's
drop it and we'll hope that either we never introduce a bug causing a
FIFO underrun in the future or that someone notices the '\0'
characters.

Yeah, tell me about it. :( ...and doing a bad job of it, too...

Right, because there was a bug.

Fair. If we care to keep this patch we could just change the memset to:

  memset(buf, '@', sizeof(buf));
