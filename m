Yeah, that sounds like better way to approach it -- I think I'll 
rearrange as Andrew suggested in 
https://lore.kernel.org/openbmc/d66753ee-7db2-41e5-9fe5-762b1ab678bc@www.fastmail.com/

I guess I might lean slightly toward keeping the DT description so that 
if for whatever reason obmc-console-server flakes out and doesn't start 
you're better positioned to try banging on /dev/ttyS* manually if you're 
desperate.  Though I suppose that in turn might imply that I'm arguing 
for adding DT properties for lpc_address and sirq too, and if you're 
really that desperate you can just fiddle with sysfs anyway, so...shrug?  
I could be convinced either way fairly easily.
