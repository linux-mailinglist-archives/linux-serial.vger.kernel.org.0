im not sure i explained that clearly

i also appear to have, not got the previous diagram right, (corrected in 
this reply for clarity) Im still getting used to plain text emails.

im not that familiar with UARTs in practice, and after re-reading i 
think i could have phrased that better, as had issue with MCU/IC UART 
TX/RX perspectives

e.g

|-----------|           |-----------|
|         TX|-----------|RX         |
| MCU UART  |           |    IC     |
|         RX|-----------|TX         |
|-----------|           |-----------|

from the mcu perspective its the TX pin, while from the RX pin from the 
ICs perspective.

from that perspective i need to pull the ICs RX pin low which means pull 
the MCU UART TX pin Low.

now this seems conceptually similar to a "break condition"

which some tty functions can produce
e.g
static int send_break(struct tty_struct *tty, unsigned int duration) 
[https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers tty/tty_io.c#L2461]

with which i might me half way to answering my own question

i can't see call to that via serdev, or equivalent


however the serdev code sits on top of the tty code 
(http://events17.linuxfoundation.org/sites/events/files/slides/serdev-elce-2017-2.pdf#Outline0.11)

it appears i would have to somehow get to the underlying send_break() 
function without breaking anything

which needs a vaild tty_struct which appears to be part of tty_port and 
can get via

struct tty_struct *tty_port_tty_get(struct tty_port *port);

and it appears that you can get that via

struct serport *serport = serdev_controller_get_drvdata(ctrl);

and can get struct serdev_controller *ctrl from struct serdev_device


but doing that cleanly is another thing.


i could either try and write something like that into the driver or 
could try and write a patch for serdev that effectively calls that 
function in tty so a serdev device can request a break from itself

unless there is a alternative im not seeing.

if there is any advice you can give that would be helpful


kind regards
