I think the locking I added to VT_GETSTATE and VT_OPENQRY is pretty
self-explanatory: it's needed because they call vt_in_use() which now requires
console_lock.  So I'm not sure what you'd like me to add there?

As for vt_in_use() itself, I already added WARN_CONSOLE_UNLOCKED() to it.
But I can add a comment to it too if it would be useful, like:

static inline bool vt_in_use(unsigned int i)
{
        const struct vc_data *vc = vc_cons[i].d;

        /*
         * console_lock must be held to prevent the vc from being deallocated
         * while we're checking whether it's in-use.
         */
        WARN_CONSOLE_UNLOCKED();

        return vc && kref_read(&vc->port.kref) > 1;
}

Yes, these are bad APIs.

Once I did remove a buggy ioctl elsewhere in the kernel rather than fixing it.
But you have to be very, very confident that nothing is using it.  That doesn't
seem to be the case for VT_GETSTATE and VT_OPENQRY as it's not hard to find code
using them.  E.g. here's another user of both of them:
https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/+/ccecf1425412beb2bc3bb38d470293fdc244d6f1/toolbox/setconsole.c

So we're probably stuck with them for now.  If you'd like to explore adding a
better API and trying to get all users to use it, you're certainly welcome to.
But it would be orthogonal to fixing this bug.
