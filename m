Yes -- I see no reason for two functions doing the very same thing. It's 
only confusing.

OK, I can do either way. I chose this path as tty_schedule_flip was a 
wrapper to tty_flip_buffer_push. In any case, I wouldn't take the number 
of changed drivers as a measure. But if it makes more sense for people 
regarding the naming, I will "flip" the two flips.

I am not a fan of cover letters as they are not Cced to people who are 
Cced in separate patches. So what would you like to see in the letter? 
This series are just a random cleanup and IMO there is not much more to 
be said except what is in their commit logs.
