Hello,

I'm to implement a work-around in the driver to stop 0xff flood caused
by malfunction of the hardware, and I got a few doubts when looking at
the code. I'd appreciate any insights on the issues below.

1. URXD_DUMMY_READ bit logic introduced to handle CREAD[1] slightly gets
in the way of implementing the work-around. I wonder why do we need
URXD_DUMMY_READ in the first place? Why don't we just disable receiver
in hardware by clearing UCR2_RXEN bit when CREAD is not set in termios?
Any specific reason for that? Is it a requirement that we still do read
everything from hardware, so that sender can't notice CREAD is cleared
on our side, or what?

2. URXD_DUMMY_READ forces break from FIFO reading loop on the first read
char, at imx.c:850. This seems to achieve nothing positive, yet it risks
to cause either needless isr re-entries, or leaving some stuck chars in
the FIFO waiting for URXD_DUMMY_READ to be cleared. Is it OK to
continue FIFO reading (and still ignoring the chars) instead?

3. Related to (2), yet another instance of code that checks for bits to be
ignored does break from the FIFO loop as well, but only after 100 chars
has been ignored at this run, at imx.c:831. This looks like protection
from something, but what's that, and how it'd protect from anything by
just exiting the loop? Don't we then need something more drastic like
disabling some IRQs or resetting the chip? It looks even more suspect as
this is the only place in the loop with such "protection". OK to get rid
of this suspect check?

4. uart_handle_sysrq_char() is called before error bits are checked, at
imx.c:817. Do we really need to consider potentially random characters
as sysrqs, and are we safe doing this? Would you support a change to
pass only cleanly received chars to sysrq?

5. imx_uart_clear_rx_errors() that is used on DMA path seems to never
considers IGN* flags: instead it always inserts BREAK, and never
OVERRUN, PARITY, or FRAME. There are no comments in the code. What's
going on here?

6. Related to (2), __imx_uart_rxint() checks USR2_BRCD in the loop when
it also has two checks for URXD_BRK later in the same loop. This
handling looks rather convoluted, yet no comments in the code are
provided. It looks like USR2_BRCD check could be at least moved out of
the loop, if not removed in favor of doing all that is needed in
URXD_BRK check.

7. __imx_uart_rxint() reads USR2 two times for every char when one time
seems to be enough. We can likely get even to zero USR2 reads, provided
we rather use URXD_CHARRDY to terminate FIFO reading loop, and get rid of
USR2_BRCD check (see (6) above). Worth to optimize?

Add CREAD flag hanlding in set_termios and UART DMA mode
which ignores all received chars when CREAD flag cleared.
