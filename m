Don't 8250 uarts have a clk divisor? I've seen other 8250 earlycon
drivers do this (see 8250_ingenic.c), that said I think it's a lost
cause for us.

BTW did you had the oportunity to have a go at the patch?

In that regard I suggest you use the upstream cpufreq driver which
behaves properly in that regard. It disables GPU freq scaling, so as to
change CPU frequencies without SPI/I2C/UART issues.
