 Thanks for assessing the problem.  I've thought already it could be 
misconfiguration.

 Agreed.

 As the first debug aid could you please enable DEBUG_AUTOCONF at the top 
of drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_port.c and paste the relevant piece of 
8250 initialisation recorded in the kernel log?  This will confirm (or 
contradict) correct operation of the port configuration sequence.

 Also I have identified a code piece that handles the EFR in a destructive 
manner, which I must have previously missed, namely a conditional block 
guarded by UART_CAP_EFR in `serial8250_do_set_termios'.  It should likely 
be fixed, however it is supposed not to matter for OxSemi chips due to:

		/* UART_CAP_EFR breaks billionon CF bluetooth card. */
		.flags		= UART_CAP_FIFO | UART_CAP_SLEEP,

which then leads to:

serial 0000:07:00.3: detected caps 00000700 should be 00000500

and consequently UART_CAP_EFR gets cleared and this code block isn't 
supposed to be reached.  Can you confirm the presence of a similar message 
in your log?

 NB it seems to me too big a hammer to have a generic serial port feature 
globally disabled to work around an unidentified problem with an attached 
particular serial device.  Pavel, as the originator of commit d0694e2aeb81 
("serial: unbreak billionton CF card") can you please explain what the 
motivation was here?

 I could only track down two message threads related to the problem:

<https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20110106134254.68fa27ac@lxorguk.ukuu.org.uk/>

and:

<https://lore.kernel.org/linux-serial/4D001AF1.80902@mainpine.com/>

but no attempt to actually narrow the issue down (also ISTM like a feature 
such as flow control ought to be controlled via a termios call rather than 
globally disabled).  Also could the corruption of the EFR in what is now 
`serial8250_do_set_termios' (and used to be `serial8250_set_termios' then) 
mentioned above be the culprit?
