That tree has been abandoned for a while, we probably should state
that in the github.  The latest tree can be found at
https://source.codeaurora.org/external/qoriq/qoriq-components/linux/

We also provide 4.19 based kernel in the codeaurora repo.  I think it
will be helpful to reuse patches there if you want to make your own
tree.

Right.  I'm really interested in getting this applied to my tree and
make it upstream.  Zhao Qiang, can you help to review Rasmus's patches
and comment?
