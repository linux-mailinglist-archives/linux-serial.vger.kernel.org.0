No doubt there will be cases were the numbering is not as stable as we'd 
like but it seems an unrelated issue.

I was talking about the system I was testing with.

So simply add the maximum number of non-discoverable ports? Something 
which isn't reusing nr_uarts or its related CONFIG, and pick such a 
default which doesn't break existing cmdlines.

You might not but we shouldn't change it to mean something else.
