LOL.  We can drop it if need be and wait to see if someone actually
ends up in the dead-zone.  Though I gotta earn the name "kernel
hacker" somehow, no?  ;-)

Actually, no.

trying to acquire lock:
ffffff81b34436a8 (&port->mutex){+.+.}-{3:3}, at: uart_poll_init+0x70/0x164
but task is already holding lock:
ffffff81b34436a8 (&port->mutex){+.+.}-{3:3}, at: uart_add_one_port+0x84/0x49c

Here's the stack (I just put a call to kgdboc_earlycon_exit_work_fn()
straight into kgdboc_earlycon_trap_exit() to reproduce which is why it
still looks like there's a worker:

uart_poll_init+0x70/0x164
tty_find_polling_driver+0x130/0x18c
configure_kgdboc+0x9c/0x164
kgdboc_earlycon_exit_work_fn+0x30/0x5c
kgdboc_earlycon_trap_exit+0x1c/0x4c
unregister_console+0xd4/0x100
register_console+0x374/0x39c
uart_add_one_port+0x418/0x49c
qcom_geni_serial_probe+0x230/0x330

If we continue on this patch I'll add it to the commit message.

Ah, I see.  So the normal console comes along an inits and kicks the
boot console out but the tty isn't there yet.  :(  I guess my solution
only works if uart_add_one_port() is used and we hit this case in
uart_configure_port():

/*
 * If this driver supports console, and it hasn't been
 * successfully registered yet, try to re-register it.
 * It may be that the port was not available.
 */

...if you've done something to register the console earlier then
you're outta luck.  I'm not sure there's a ton we can do here.  I
don't think we can really transition over to running kgdb on the main
console because, if nothing else, the write() function for those tend
to grab "uport->lock" which doesn't seem like it's always safe.  Then
there'd be the problem of adding read() to all these consoles and
assuming it's non-blocking.

I feel like maybe the best that can be done is, now that earlycon
works as well as it does, to suggest that people _stop_ trying to
register their main console so early.  ;-)

(OK, now that I've read your 2nd message I guess there is something we
can do: keep using the boot console).


In general, though, my patch shouldn't necessarily make anything
_worse_ for you.  When the boot console's exit() routine is called
then you really can't use it any more.  It shouldn't hurt to check if
the TTY is available so we can switch right away.  I guess if your
case is common, though, we'd maybe want to get rid of the
cleanup_earlycon() in kgdboc_earlycon_exit_work_fn() because if you
attached gdb in kgdb_earlycon the debug_core will throw its hissyfit.
We can just cross our fingers and hope the TTY comes along before we
end up in the debugger again.

This is weird.  Why don't I see this?  Oh, I see.  It's because your
console is replacing the boot console so early so "workqueue_init"
hasn't run yet.  Mine happens much, much later.

...I can try to dig more if we want to continue going down this path,
but in general it should be fine to grab a mutex on a worker, right?
...and the workers shouldn't start running until it's safe to run?  Is
this just a race where we don't set "wq_online = true" early enough
and pending work has run or something?  Maybe if you drop into the
debugger at the time of this warning you'll find that some other task
is running and somewhere midway though workqueue_init()?
