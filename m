Hi all,
I realize that my previous message was inappropriate and may have
given the wrong impression - my apologies.

To clarify, I am not trying to control the community
or block upstream work. I misunderstood the right
way to express myself before, and I take my
previous mail back.

Thank you for your guidance and patience. As a
newcomer to the Linux community, I am still
learning how to properly contribute.

If Junhui has further technical questions, please
feel free to contact me in this thread. I am happy to
help and to welcome contributions from the
community.

Best regards,
fushan
