Perhaps.
Samuel opted not to add supm to dt when he introduced the other relevant
extensions, so the rationale from him would be helpful but I'd like to
get more opinions on how to deal with supm specifically. supm doesn't
really describe hardware capability, since the privilege specific
instructions are what does that, which makes me question if it should be
in dt at all. On the other hand, it could be argued that supm describes
a combination of hardware capability at the dt consumer's privilege level
and is valid on that basis. Some wording like Zkr will probably be needed,
specifically mentioning that having supm in the dt means that corresponding
version sxnpm for the privilege level that the devicetree is provided to
is supported.

Either way, we are going to need something in cpufeature.c to imply
supm so that it appears to userspace if the privilege specific extension
is detected and supm is enabled in the kernel. The kernel already does
the implication internally it just isn't reported as an extension to
userspace IIRC.
If we permit supm in dt, we're also going to have to turn supm off if
the Kconfig option is disabled, but that's relatively little effort
since it mostly (or maybe entirely) reuses code from implying supm.
