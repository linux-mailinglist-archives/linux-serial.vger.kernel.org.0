I'm not sure. The title is "DesignWare DW_apb_uart Databook" in case that

No. My point was that it would be nice to figure out a sequence of 
operations that is guaranteed to get BUSY deasserted. It helps both LCR 
(only) write problem and the divisor update problem because the cause for 
them seems to be the same.

So replacing dw8250_force_idle() with something like what is below might 
be useful.

I still don't understand why the FIFO needs to be disabled but included it 
into the idle sequence anyway.

In contrast to earlier:
  - FIFO is not reset but it could be added into the idle exit function if 
    it's a desirable feature.
  - IER is zeroed to prevent RBR filling triggering an interrupt (with 
    port's lock held here it's going to just keep attempt to acquire the 
    lock).
  - LCR write is handled as well (w/o now triggering extra FIFO reinits).
  - Flush DMA Rx


[PATCH 1/1] serial: 8250_dw: Ensure BUSY is deasserted

DW UART cannot write to LCR, DLL, and DLH while BUSY is asserted.
Existance of BUSY depends on uart_16550_compatible, if UART HW is
configured with 16550 compatible those registers can always be
written.

There currently is dw8250_force_idle() which attempts to archive
non-BUSY state by disabling FIFO, however, the solution is unreliable
when Rx keeps getting more and more characters.

Create a sequence of operations to enforce that ensures UART cannot
keep BUSY asserted indefinitely. The new sequence relies on enabling
loopback mode temporarily to prevent incoming Rx characters keeping
UART BUSY.

Use the new dw8250_idle_enter/exit() to do divisor writes and LCR
writes.
