No, I wasn't.  I was looking for a drm replacement for the drivers/tty/vt
code inside the kernel.  I may have misunderstood Greg when he referred
to a replacement which uses drm.

kmscon doesn't seem to be a suitable replacement for the Linux console.
According to Wikipedia, it stopped being maintained ~10 years ago.  Also,
it is a user level program, not a kernel level program, so will only become
active later in the boot process than the current console, which is not
a good thing.  It might well steal key sequences from application
programs, the way X and X window managers do, but maybe it doesn't.  On
Gentoo, kmscon is "masked", i.e. strongly recommended not to be
installed, and installable only after taking special measures.
