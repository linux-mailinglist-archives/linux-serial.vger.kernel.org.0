Yeah, that not being documented seems like an oversight as generally
drivers should not need be changed to continue working on PREEMPT_RT (or
with forced-threading generally).

All interrupt handlers typically run in hard interrupt context unless
explicitly requested to be threaded on !RT and drivers still use
spinlock_t for that so not sure how that lockdep warning is supposed to
work. Or do you mean that you have a lockdep warning specifically for
IRQF_ONESHOT primary handlers?

The author did not seem to think this was stable material as there is no
cc-stable tag and it also seems fairly intrusive.

But if the ST guys or whoever cares about this driver are fine with this
being backported, I don't really mind either.
