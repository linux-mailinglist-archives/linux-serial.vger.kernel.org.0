This patch series causes the following build warning to be added:

drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_pci.c: In function ‘pci_oxsemi_tornado_setup’:
drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_pci.c:1258:32: warning: unsigned conversion from ‘int’ to ‘unsigned char’ changes value from ‘-129’ to ‘127’ [-Woverflow]
 1258 |                 up->mcr_mask = ~UART_MCR_CLKSEL;
      |                                ^


Can you fix this up and resend?
