Thanks. I'll try to come up with another debug patch tomorrow to further 
inspect the payload that will be read after that point.

In the meantime you could try if the following patch is enough 
to solve the issue.


From: Ilpo Järvinen <ilpo.jarvinen@linux.intel.com>
Subject: [PATCH] serial: 8250: Prevent starting up DMA Rx on THRI interrupt

Hans de Goede reported Bluetooth adapters (HCIs) connected over an UART
connection failed due corrupted Rx payload. The problem was narrowed
down to DMA Rx starting on UART_IIR_THRI interrupt. The problem occurs 
despite LSR having DR bit set, which is precondition for attempting to 
start DMA Rx.

This problem became apparent after e8ffbb71f783 ("serial: 8250: use
THRE & __stop_tx also with DMA") changed Tx stopping to get triggered
using THRI interrupt.

Don't setup DMA Rx on UART_IIR_THRI but leave it to a subsequent
interrupt which has Rx related IIR value.
