It has always been like that for this driver. But that should be no
reason why the driver might not be improved. I wonder how the 8250
handles this. PC's have always shared interrupts for COM1/2/3/4 AFAIK.

That depends on the IRQ coming out of the interrupt controller. If that 
is
a level interrupt itself, then it is easy to see if all interrupts are
handled. Further polling zooms in on the devices that require attention.

If you would require multiple sc16is7xx devices on I2C would you like to
connect multiple interrupt lines? Or just SCL,SDA and *one* IRQ?

OTOH for SPI you would require multiple CS already.

That sounds like a decent plan.
