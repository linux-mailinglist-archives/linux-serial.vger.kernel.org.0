Cool, thanks for the pointer.

Why are the two uarts split into different device nodes? It looks like
it's one device that was split into two nodes because they're fairly
similar hardware blocks, and one or the other may not be used on the
board so we want to use status =3D "disabled" to indicate that. Sadly the
hardware team has delivered them as a single package into the SoC at
address 0x12000 and then stuck a common clk for both uarts into the same
uart wrapper. Here's a clk, job done!

Is it a problem to map UART1 address space when it isn't used on the
board? I'm trying to understand why it can't work to register two uart
ports from one device node and driver. It seems to be the main reason
why we're introducing another node for the clk registers when it feels
like it could all be handled in the existing uart driver.

For example, we could have a static clk pointer in the uart driver
indicating the clk has been registered, and then register the clk if
uart1 or uart2 is the first device to probe and then store that clk in a
global (with clk_hw_get_clk(), I think that's a thing now). If uart2
probes first it can take the reg property and subtract some number to
find the clk, and if uart1 probes first it can take the reg property and
add some number to find the clk. Either way, the binding doesn't change
in this case and we don't have to add another binding for this same uart
hardware.

Then if someone wants to cleanup the binding they can combine both uarts
into one node, make a new compatible string and add some property to
indicate that one or the other uart isn't used. Probably also add some
property to map the uart alias to the uart hardware block inside the
wrapper node.
