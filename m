 The specification doesn't require a barrier *after* a write however, 
which is what I have been concerned about as it may cost hundreds of 
cycles wasted.  I'm not concerned about a barrier after a read (and one 
beforehand is of course also required).

 Adding artificial delays will only paper over the real problem I'm 
afraid.

 It does have a barrier, see:

	/* prevent prefetching of coherent DMA data prematurely */	\
	if (!relax)							\
		rmb();							\

In the light of #5 however:

        5. A readX() by a CPU thread from the peripheral will complete before
           any subsequent delay() loop can begin execution on the same thread.

I think it may have to be replaced with a completion barrier however, and 
that will be tricky because you cannot just issue a second read to the 
resource accessed after the `rmb' to make the first read complete, as a 
MMIO read may have side effects (e.g. clearing an interrupt request).  So 
the read would have to happen to a different location.

 Some architectures have a hardware completion barrier instruction, such 
as the modern MIPS ISA, which makes life sweet and easy (as much as life 
can be sweet and easy with a weakly ordered bus model) as no dummy read is 
then required, but surely not all do (including older MIPS ISA revisions).
