It is a problem-specific hack. You will need to be certain that CPU1-7
will never have problems with console printing storms.

Be aware that vprintk_safe() is not particularly reliable in many crash
scenarios. If seeing oops output on the console is important, this can
be a risky hack.

Also, be aware that it has its own config option for the safe buffer
size: PRINTK_SAFE_LOG_BUF_SHIFT

Yes, it would be quite easy. The console printers run as dedicated
kthreads. It is only a matter of setting the CPU affinity for the
related kthread.

I am only aware of the quilt "series" file [0] that is roughly
documenting the status of the effort.
