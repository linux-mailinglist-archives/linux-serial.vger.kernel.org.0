What hardware are you testing for all of this and what drivers for these
devices?  And what kernel version?

Note that usb-serial devices are very odd and cheap and do strange
things because they are so cheap.  They also have the uart hardware off
at the end of a usb connection and so are not able to be fully
controlled by the operating system for some devices (while others are,
but those are usually more expensive devices.)

Also there are many "fake" usb-serial devices out there that sometimes
work differently than the real ones, so watch out as well.

And further, when using stty for some usb-serial devices, they used to
reset their settings when stty closed, making the tool pretty useless.
Depending on your kernel version and device, you need to watch out for
this and not rely on stty, but rather the program when you start it up
needs to set the proper line settings that you need for the device and
never rely on a previous program getting the state set up properly.

Also note that when closing a port (you are aborting a program while it
is running), the state of the uart/tty device is not always in a known
state to userspace anymore.

So what exactly is the problem that you are trying to solve here and
what normal workflow has programs being aborted while running?

Depends on the hardware :)

If the data is already sent to the kernel from userspace, how can
userspace be responsible anymore?

I do not understand this question, sorry.
