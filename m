Ick no.  Custom sysfs attributes for things like serial ports are crazy.

Why can't this be a device tree attribute?  Why does this have to be a
sysfs thing that no one will know how to tune and set over time.  This
hardware should not force a user to manually tune it to get it to work
properly, this isn't the 1990's anymore :(

Please never force a user to choose stuff like this, they never will
know what to do.
