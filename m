I'm a bit confused. Right now we're using (effectively) a 64-byte
FIFO. The FIFO is 16-words deep and we have 4 bytes per word. ...so
I'm not sure what you mean by switching to a 16-byte FIFO. Do you mean
to make less use of the FIFO, or something else?

Overall the big problem I found in all my testing was that I needed to
wait for a "command done" before kicking off a new command. When the
"command done" arrives then the UART has stopped transmitting and
you've got to suffer an interrupt latency before you can start
transferring again. Essentially:

1. Pick a transfer size.
2. You can keep sending bytes / using the FIFO efficiently as long as
there are still bytes left in the transfer.
3. When you get to the end of the transfer, you have to wait for the
UART to stop, report that it's done, and then suffer an interrupt
latency to start a new transfer.

So to be efficient you want to pick a big transfer size but if there's
any chance that you might not need to transfer that many bytes then
you need to figure out what to do. If you can handle that properly
then that's great. If not then we have to make sure we never kick off
a transfer that we might not finish.

I'd also mention that, as talked about in my response to your other
patch [1], I'm not seeing a 25% slowdown. I tested both with my simple
proposal and with this whole series applied and my slowdown is less
than 2%. I guess there must be something different with your setup?
Trying to think about what kind of slowdown would be reasonable for my
patch series at 115200:

a) We send 64 bytes efficiently, which takes 5.6ms (64 * 1000 / 11520)

b) We stop transferring and wait for an interrupt.

c) We start transferring 64 bytes again.

Let's say that your interrupt latency is 1 ms, which would be really
terrible. In that case you'll essentially transfer 64 bytes in 6.6ms
instead of 5.6 ms, right? That would be an 18% hit. Let's imagine
something more sensible and say that most of the time you can handle
an interrupt in 100 ms. That would be about a 1.7% slowdown, which
actually matches what I was seeing. For reference, even an old arm32
rk3288-veyron device I worked with years ago could usually handle
interrupts in ~100-200 ms since dwc2 needs you to handle at least one
(sometimes more) interrupt per USB uFrame (250ms).

...so I'm confused about where your 25% number is coming from...
