Yes, there are some details like that would need to be worked out.

Hmm, good point. I'll see if I can ask someone with access to docs.

But I guess we can still continue to stop the command on stop_tx() (as
we are considering anyway) to avoid that.

That may be the case. I'm not seeing more interrupts with the last patch
applied, and not more time spent servicing interrupts (based on a quick
look at top), so it may just be geni taking a lot of time to start or
stop commands.

No, I had confirmed that it is using 16 words (64 bytes).

I do, yes.

Yes, there has been no console output during my tests, and I get similar
results with the console disabled.
