So only the *initial* value of MCR[1] is wrong and prevents receiving.
But once you've sent some data, RTS is deasserted correctly and you can
receive again.  Did I understand that correctly?

I'm missing an important piece of information here:  Are you using
inverse polarity for RTS?  Normally MCR[1] should be 1 to transmit
and 0 to receive, per the figure on page 8734 of this document:

https://www.ti.com/lit/ug/spruid7e/spruid7e.pdf

Thus, setting up->mcr = 0 should be perfectly fine because it results
in RTS being deasserted, so the transceiver is in receive mode.

I suspect that you're using inverse polarity for RTS, so the desired
initial value of MCR[1] is 1 in your case.  Is that correct?

You write above that "the MCR[1] should be constant to indicate the
current direction is receiving".  That sentence is missing the desired
value, i.e. should MCR[1] be constant 1 or constant 0?

I suspect that the incorrect value in MCR[1] is evaluated by
omap8250_set_mctrl() via this call stack:
  omap_8250_set_termios()
    omap8250_restore_regs()
      up->port.ops->set_mctrl()

Could you confirm this please by inserting a dump_stack() in
omap8250_set_mctrl()?

I would also like to know if you have set UPSTAT_AUTORTS on the port
by enabling hardware flow-control (CRTSCTS) on the tty.  That would
cause omap8250_set_mctrl to fiddle with UART_EFR_RTS bit and I think
the user-visible result is that the transceiver is switched to
transmit mode when the "RX FIFO HALT trigger level" is reached.
We should probably stop it from doing that.

Thanks,

Lukas
