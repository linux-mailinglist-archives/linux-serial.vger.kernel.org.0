This is a controller that, right now, is only used to instantiate device 
power management controls, but the controller itself is just a generic 
syscon device. Depending on the register range, it could conceivably 
encompass other register types (e.g. clock selects) within it, though 
I'm not sure I want to do that right now. Apple calls several of these 
different register sets as a whole a "PMGR". So I'm not sure if it 
really qualifies as "just" a power domain controller. If we want to 
restrict this to the power state portion of PMGR, then it might make 
sense to call it something more specific...

See arm/rockchip/pmu.yaml for the setup this is modeled after.

It's a syscon, it does nothing on its own. All the work is done by the 
child nodes and the driver that binds to those.

Fixed for v2.
