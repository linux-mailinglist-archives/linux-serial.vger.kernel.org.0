Hello,
I am very pleased the Mr. Greg Kroah-Hartman is writing to me in person!

I appreciate a lot sir!

We are the vendor. ;-)

Jokes apart, I can try to use the latest kernel 5.6, and see how is 
going on them, but at the first check the driver seems exactly the same 
as in kernel 4.9.

I am not native english speaker so I am misleading to a 
misunderstanding: my test case is a software with two pthreads which the 
main thread is working with a differnet baud rate than the other 
pthread. Using the same software in two different machines, and using 
the same baudrate for each corrispondant port it should work.

i.e. /dev/ttyAPP1 is running at 9600 and /dev/ttyAPP2 is running at 38400

The same in the other machine. Both ports are null-modem connected:

	9600  /dev/ttyAPP1 <----> /dev/ttyAPP1 9600
	38400 /dev/ttyAPP2 <----> /dev/ttyAPP2 38400

I hope to be clear now. ;-)

Unfortunately no flow control. Because the I cannot use it. When 
connected to the real-hardware those two ports are connected to a 
microcontroller unit which does not have flow control, only RX & TX 
connected (i.e. no RTS/CTS/DTE/DCE lines)

As above, no [ unfortunately ]

I suppose that, but the same issue can be proven with all single core 
(NO FIFO UART) processors using two ports on the same uart core, running 
Linux kernel @ 450 Mhz or less.

The irq latency it is the same.

I know and usually I am using a sort of protocol which can check 
correctness of packet, and if not, the packet has to be reasked/resent.
In this case the microcontroller board I am connected to is not built by 
us, and the software is a custom protocol (and I do not know if an error 
on transfer can be accomplished by another request).

So the flow control __CANNOT_BE_USED_AT_ALL__...

...and in our case is working better than the internal uart driver on 
the same board. It is a real pity...

Thanks to you, mr. greg k-h!

P.S.: I am a very close friend of Andrea Arcangeli, we grew up in the 
same place, and we went in the same school here in Italy (Imola - bologna).

We used to talked about you last Christmas Holidays when Andrea came to 
Italy from NY
