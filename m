All hacks could be viewed that way :)

There's no specific reason, but we are stuck with what we have today as
that is how things work.  I'm more worried about making this change and
then nothing ever changes in userspace.  And userspace would never
"know" if it could or could not rely on this change, as some
necro-enterprise-systems never update their kernel.

How would such a runtime check work?  Do you have working patches for
existing userspace programs that want to know this that shows how this
all works?

We can't take api changes without a working userspace user, you know
that...

Yes, that's why I suggested a new ioctl.
