Hello Christoph,

let me first say, for an upcoming new product we are currently
developing, we tried different wirings, all related to that !RE pin of
the transceiver.

In a first hardware revision the engineer doing the schematic
connected !RE to GND (always on) and it took me a while to recognize
what was going on: everything send through TX was mirrored on RX,
which makes using lots of standard applications on that port just
fail.  (To be fair, we need exactly that behaviour on a different
board.)

In a second iteration !RE is directly connected to DE now, so RE is
now always the opposite of DE.  DE itself is always connected to the
RTS line of the UART, which allows the driver to switch direction.

More below.

Better.  But what about the questions Rob asked?  There's already a
property 'rs485-rx-during-tx' which leads to setting the flag
SER_RS485_RX_DURING_TX in serial core.  As far as I understood from a
quick glance at core and drivers, this deals with half or full duplex
from the UART point of view (not the transceiver).

You need to explain, what's the difference to the new property.
I suspect you want to somehow switch behaviour with that GPIO line?
Which driver should switch that line in the end and when?

(For third iteration of our hardware we thought about a GPIO
controlling whether !RE is always on or connected to DE, but that's
probably not what you have in mind?)

Maybe a simple generic schematic could help explain or maybe you find
a better name for the property?
