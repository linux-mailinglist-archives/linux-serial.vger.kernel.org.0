Well, it is very easy to add a 16550 in the programmable logic of a 
Zynq.
Worse, it's impossible to only add uartps devices as the IP for it is
not available to the public.
It is less easy to add a 16550 to a CPU with ttyAMA but no external bus.
But if you add e.g. an I2C/SPI based SC16IS7xx which generates ttySCx 
you
might have the same problems.

But the problem is worse. What happens if you give the serial0 alias to
a xilinx_uartps and the 16550 driver has already taken ttyS0? (Or vice
versa?) Will the uartps still use ttyPS0 or will it ignore the serial0
alias? I predict the latter.

I see only two ways out.
* Let uartps generate ttySx device names, or
* Do not use serialN alias to set the number.

It was already stated that it is impossible to have ttyPS1 and no 
ttyPS0.
That would mean we cannot give serial0 to ttyS0 and serial1 to ttyPS1.
This makes me wonder if the opposite is valid: to give serial0 to ttyPS0
and serial1 to ttyS1. Probably not either.

There really needs to be a way to create deterministic names for the
devices!

What I meant to say is that apparently U-boot requires serial0 to point 
to
the user-interface. This limits your options when assigning aliases. If
U-boot would use a different entry (e.g. "console" or better yet
"earlycon") things might be easier. serial0 should not be special IMHO.

But let's not diverge too much here.
