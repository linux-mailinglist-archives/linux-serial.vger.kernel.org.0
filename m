The patch makes sense.

My main (only) concern was the synchronization of the various accessed
variables, especially, port->cons.

Note: I am not completely sure how the early and valid console drivers
      share the same struct uart_port. So, maybe I miss some important
      guarantee.

Anyway. synchronization of port->cons looks like a shade area.
IMHO, the existing code expects that it is used _only when the console
is registered_. But this patch wants to access it _even before
the console is registered_!

For example, it took me quite a lot of time to shake my head around:

#define uart_console(port) \
	((port)->cons && (port)->cons->index == (port)->line)

  + port->cons and port->line are updated in the uart code.
    It seems that the update is not serialized by port->lock.
    Something might be done under port->mutex.

  + cons->index is updated in register_console() under
    console_list_lock.

Spoiler: I propose a solution which does not use uart_console().

See below for more details.

I am not sure if the variable really helps anything:

   + nbcon_context release() must handle the case when it
     lost the ownership anyway.

     It is the same as if it did not acquire the context
     in the first place [*].


   + nbcon_acquire() is called under port->lock. It means that
     nbcon_release() should always be called when the acquire
     succeeded earlier.

We just need to make sure that port->cons can be cleared only
under port->lock. But this would be required even with
port->nbcon_locked_port.

[*] I am not super-happy with this semantic because it prevents
    catching bugs by lockdep. But it is how nbcon_acquire/release
    work and it is important part of the design.


Apology: It is possible that I suggested to add this variable. I just
	see now that it does not really help much. It rather makes
	a false feeling about that nbcon acquire/release are always
	paired.

This function accesses up->cons. I am not completely sure how
this value is synchronized, for example:

  + serial_core_add_one_port() sets uport->cons under port->mutex.
    The function is called uart_add_one_port() in various probe()
    or init() calls.

  + univ8250_console_setup() sets and clears port->cons with
    no explicit synchronization. The function is called from
    try_enable_preferred_console() under console_list_lock.

IMHO, the assignment is done when the drivers are being initialized.
It is done when the port might already be used by early consoles.

Especially, according to my understanding, newcon->setup() callbacks
are responsible for using the same port by early and real console drivers.

I guess that uart_port_lock() API is used by early consoles as well.
It means that they might access up->cons here while it is being
manipulated by the proper driver.

A minimal solution would be access/modify port->cons using
READ_ONCE()/WRITE_ONCE().

But I think that we do not need to call uart_console() at all.
We do not really need to synchronize the consistency of
con->index and port->line.

Instead, we could read up->cons using READ_ONCE() and
check if it is defined. Or even better would be to always
set/read port->cons under the port->lock.

Hmm, console_srcu_read_flags(con) is called under
console_srcu_read_lock() to make sure that it does not
disappear. It makes sense when it is used by registered consoles.

But uart_port_lock() might be called even when the console
is not registered.

I suggest to remove the SRCU lock here. In this code path,
it does not guarantee anything and is rather misleading.

I would use a READ_ONCE(), for example by splitting:

/*
 * Locklessly reading console->flags provides a consistent
 * read value because there is at most one CPU modifying
 * console->flags and that CPU is using only read-modify-write
 * operations to do so.
 *
 * The caller must make sure that @con does not disappear.
 * It can be done by console_srcu_read_lock() when used
 * only for registered consoles.
 */
static inline short console_read_flags(const struct console *con)
{
	return data_race(READ_ONCE(con->flags));
}

/* Locklessly reading console->flags for registered consoles */
static inline short console_srcu_read_flags(const struct console *con)
{
	WARN_ON_ONCE(!console_srcu_read_lock_is_held());

	console_read_flags();
}

I would prefer to split the uart and nbcon specific code, for example:

	} while (!nbcon_context_enter_unsafe(&ctxt));
}

This deserves a comment why we do not complain when this function
is called for nbcon and it is not locked. Something like:

	/*
	 * Even port used by nbcon console might be seen unlocked
	 * when it was locked and the console has been registered
	 * at the same time.
	 */
> +	if (!up->nbcon_locked_port)

Wait, if up->cons might be set asynchronously then it might also
disapper assynchronously. Which would be really bad because we would
not be able to release the normal context.

IMHO, we really need to synchronize up->cons acceess using up->lock.

Again I would better split the nbcon and uart part and create:

/**
 * nbcon_normal_context_release - Release a generic context with
 *	the normal priority.
 * @con:	nbcon console
 *
 * Context:	Any context which could not be migrated to another CPU.
 *
 * Release a generic context with the normal priority for the given console.
 * Prevent the release by entering the unsafe state.
 *
 * Note: The console might have lost the ownership by a hostile takeover.
 *	 But it should not happen in reality because the hostile
 *       takeover is allowed only for the final flush in panic()
 *	 when other CPUs should be stopped and other contexts interrupted.
 */
static void nbcon_normal_context_release(struct console *con)
{
	struct nbcon_context ctxt = {
		.console	= con,
		.prio		= NBCON_PRIO_NORMAL,
	};

	if (nbcon_context_exit_unsafe(&ctxt))
		nbcon_context_release(&ctxt);
}

/**

void uart_nbcon_release(struct uart_port *up)
{
	struct console *con;

	lockdep_assert_held(&up->lock);

	 *

	 */
	con = data_race(READ_ONCE(up->cons));

	if (!con)
		return;

	if (!console_read_flags(con) & CON_NBCON)

	nbcon_normal_context_release(con);
