Yes it does.  Starting out at 115200 in minicom I confirmed the loss of the
first character.  I changed the line speed to 38400 in minicom and the next
character to be pressed was dropped.  All others after it were fine.  I then
returned to 115200 in minicom and the pattern repeated: the first character
after the speed change was lost, but all others came through.  All these
tests were done in the same minicom session under kernel 672c0c5 with the

  val |= BIT(7);

line still commented out.

Unfortunately the patch didn't bring back the first character.  The first
character is still missed (immediately after starting minicom, and also
after changing the line speed within minicom), but all others are delivered
as they should be.

I assume the "above line" is the

  val |= BIT(7);

statement in ch341_set_baudrate_lcr().  With this line commented out in the
"v4.10" tag (c470abd), the first character is lost but all others are
send/received as expected.  As you suggested, this appears to rule out
later changes as the source of the lost first character.

I can confirm that this USB-serial converter has apparently been working
fine for me with kernel 4.4.14 (and continued to do so up until the comment
identified by the bisect).  This wasn't just with the programmer hardware
though.  I was also using a second identical CH341 USB-serial converter with
minicom for debugging of external hardware, and this also worked fine under
4.4.14.  Given the comment in the commit you referenced above, it may be
that we were just lucky.  Whatever the reason, these two CH341 version 0x27
converters have definitely been working in practice for me.

Yes, having been there myself I totally agree.
