A few meta-comments about the patch.

Look at how other patches are submitted, there's no need for this type
of introduction in the changelog text, and in fact, you have no
changelog text in your patch at all.  So the body of this email needs to
go into the changelog area, please do so when you resend.

New module parameters should never be added, as they only affect the
whole system, and not on a per-device basis.  If you have to add new
options, please do it some other way.

Also, by adding new options, that means you are changing the logic here,
why not create a new line discipline that acts the way you want it to
act?  The existing one is very small, it should not be much to make a
new one with just the new functionality, right?

The current code is only 141 lines long, you doubled it, so I think a
seprate driver would be simpler :)

You can remove your debugging code as well.

This is a pretty big abuse of CTS.  I understand your want for something
like this, but why not get a device that has a DCD line instead?

That's my biggest objection here, it feels like you are working around
really odd hardware with this change.  What real-world use case is this
for?

You also say you can handle this in userspace already, so why would this
have to be in the kernel?  What benefit is it for us to take this?

thanks,
