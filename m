 It's broken in a trivial way and would be fixed by a competent developer 
in no time.  If no one has reported the breakage, it means no one has used 
this code in a way that would trigger it, e.g. -Wno-error in effect would 
mask the compilation issue.  I'm fairly sure I used this code while making 
changes to the OxSemi Tornado backend a couple of years ago.

 Well, what can I say beyond the obvious?  That debugging a mature driver 
doesn't happen all the time?  This would typically happen when adding a 
new chip-specific backend, and I don't think new variants of 8250-style 
serial ports appear that often nowadays.

 You can argue one can insert these debug statements back if they need it, 
but someone already made this effort years ago, so why waste it?  To save 
a handful of source lines?  It doesn't seem a good justification to me.

 There's no need to rebuild everything, handing CFLAGS_8250_port.o=-DDEBUG 
to `make' only causes the named object to be recompiled.  I use it all the 
time, also to pass other compilation flags if needed (call me outdated if 
you prefer).

 Any kind of run-time selectable debugging would bloat the kernel binary 
unnecessarily for everyone, for the corner case of driver development or 
debugging.  Unless made optional at configuration or build time, but then 
we're back to the "1990's solution" with little to no gain over the local 
CFLAGS override.

 And if working on a piece of code, then rebuilding it sooner or later 
seems inevitable anyway, so what's the deal?
