Fully agree removing SERIAL_UARTLITE_NR_UARTS and making allocation 
dynamic is best.
Please briefly advise on how to best handle the following resulting issue:

In  serial_core.c  the following check occurs:

int uart_add_one_port(struct uart_driver *drv, struct uart_port *uport)
{
...
	if (uport->line >= drv->nr)
		return -EINVAL;
		

To not let this fail on registering a legit uartlite port, should we

* Set  ulite_uart_driver.nr = INT_MAX  before registering the driver
* Adjust  ulite_uart_driver.nr  when adding or removing a port (surely 
with lock, but still smells)
* do something blindingly obvious I'm missing?

Thank you,
Ruediger
