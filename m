What mailing list? I'd like to be in on this.

The port-number is optional, but currently automatically generated. The 
same goes
for the aliases. How can one remove them from the device-tree? Is 
overwriting the
only option? If so, what value would you recommend?

If, and only if, devices would start to use the same name would the 
serial alias
become a decent solution. But I'm sure that the 8250 driver currently 
does not
supports e.g. ttyS25 when SERIAL_8250_NR_UARTS is configured for only 4 
devices.

As a workaround I always patch the xilinx_uartps.c driver to also 
support
port-number. This way I can overwrite the port-number values in the 
device-tree
to get them numbered ttyPS0 and ttyPS1. And then I can use the serial 
alias for
my 16550's.

&uart0 {
         port-number = <0>;                      // this is a 
xilinx_uartps
};

&uart1 {
         port-number = <1>;                      // this is a 
xilinx_uartps
};

&liteuarts_axi_uartlite_0 {
         port-number = <0>;                      // this is a uartlite
};

&liteuarts_axi_uartlite_1 {
         port-number = <1>;                      // this is a uartlite
};
[...]
&liteuarts_axi_uartlite_10 {
         port-number = <10>;                     // this is a uartlite
};

The 16550's also received a port-number but the driver ignores that.

aliases {
         serial0 = &uart0;
         serial1 = &fulluarts_axi_uart16550_1;
         serial2 = &fulluarts_axi_uart16550_2;
         serial3 = &fulluarts_axi_uart16550_3;
         serial4 = &fulluarts_axi_uart16550_4;
         serial5 = &fulluarts_axi_uart16550_5;
         serial6 = &fulluarts_axi_uart16550_6;
         serial7 = &fulluarts_axi_uart16550_7;
         serial8 = &fulluarts_axi_uart16550_0;
};

Note how I had to abuse serial8 to get the 16550_0 at ttyS0 with
SERIAL_8250_NR_UARTS=8. This does leave me with several dangling serial 
aliases
in the final device tree.

The fact that I have to use this workaround to me means that the serial 
naming
and numbering system is broken.

If you ask me, the solution is not to start using the serial alias, but 
abandon it
and go for port-number entirely, at least for uartlite and 
xilinx_uartps. But
eventually also for the 8250 driver and all others.

Btw. the port-number and the MSS also don't sort natural, but purely 
alphabetical.
axi_uartlite_10 comes before axi_uartlite_2. Maybe I should have renamed 
them
with a leading zero myself.
