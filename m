If no_console_suspend is set then GENPD_FLAG_ALWAYS_ON makes sense to
me as we want to see the debug messages. This will also alter the SoCs
suspend state though, so no_console_suspend is of limited use. Can you
please send an updated patch against tty-next branch for this?

It would be good to understand why the related power domain gets suspended
with active runtime PM usage count though. To me it seems this might be
an issue somewhere in the SoC related power domain code that just tries
to force suspend everything.

Regards,

Tony
