The objective is not to define things with divergent meanings anyway,
only to say "this string is exactly this version of this extension",
so that if some other version of an extension comes along we have a way
to differentiate. We didn't before and that became problematic for both
standard extensions and vendor specific stuff. You'll note we don't look
to define anything ourselves, just cite the spec that provides the
definitions.

By and large what's in cpufeature.c is there to turn extensions off
based on kconfig choices (vector support enabled etc) or kernel design
decisions (kernel requiring both d and f extensions for fpu support). I
don't think there's anything there that doesn't assume that the
devicetree is correct. For my money, it's much simpler to describe
dependencies in a binding than add more code to the kernel that tries to
figure out dependencies at runtime.
