Naturally no objection from me for reverting if there are issues that are
unfixable from the printk point of view. I'll update the fix along the
lines you're suggesting below though, let's see if that's enough for the
-rc cycle.

I think the DEVNAME originates from udev to be used for various rules. Yes
it should be documented somewhere though. I'd say it's stable as it's been
in use for years :)

I think we want to keep it generic with DEVNAME, I don't see why we'd want
make it serial console specific, at least in the code. For the documentation,
I think the kernel parameters example  is clear on the serial port usage?

Because ACPI serial driver takes over the serial8250 port. Yes we are
recycling the preallocated serial8250 ports for the hardware specific
drivers.. That always adds some extra confusion on the top :)

I believe this would be the situation if you make CONFIG_ACPI is not set
in the .config.

PCI and USB use a ":" already for the device naming. Also a "-" can be used
by the device names, many platform devices do that. I don't think we can
pick any better limiter here, at least out of the ":", "-" and "." options.

Not pointing to the same device, we now have serial port controller
devices. Each serial port controller device may have one or more serial
port devices. So in your example above, only "00:00:0.0" is a serial port
device, the others are serial port controller devices.

So above you have these:

- 00:00:0 is the first ACPI 8250 serial controller device

- 00:00:0.0 is the first serial port instance for controller 00:00:0 above

- serial8250:0 is the first serial8250 controller instance

On startup (and if ACPI is disabled) ttyS0 maps to the first serial8250
controler port instance as mapped in arch/x86/include/asm/serial.h. Then
the ACPI using serial driver (or whatever hardware specific driver) may
take over the serial8250 port instance.

No

>     Why the "expected" serial8250:0.0 is missing?

Because the serial8250 port instance got taken over by the ACPI using
hardware specific driver :)

OK makes sense to drop the struct console_option now in favor of
struct console_cmdline. Will update accordingly.

Maybe we should just drop the ifdef in struct console_cmdline.h to avoid
the ifdef.

Seems these will go away by dropping the struct console_option.

OK that should be unified.

Yes I've seen parts of that nightmare :) Never expected this to spread

No need for conopt[] if we can use console_cmdline[].

Yes no need for it if things are handled directly in printk.c.
