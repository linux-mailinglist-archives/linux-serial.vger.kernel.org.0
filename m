Why do you think it is useful?

Is that possible?  If so, how?  Has it ever worked before?  Who requires
this to work?  Does this bus and hardware support this type of
functionality for this hardware device?

Who created this test case and what were they expecting to have happen?
What are they thinking this test case should be doing?  Is this a new
functionality that they need Linux to support?  If so, then new code
probably has to be written :)

bind/unbind is a "best effort" type of thing, not all busses and
hardware types support this at all.
