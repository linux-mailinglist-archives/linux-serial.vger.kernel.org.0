That sounds like a broken hardware design.

Then put something like this in the changelog text, as it is, it is not
descriptive at all.

But that does not actually do anything different from what it does
today.  And it has nothing to do with the lock, so this should be 2
different patches, right?

But this does not change the logic as if cnt is 0, nothing gets pushed
with the current code either, right?

Then make it a separate patch, independant from the lock patch, and we
can discuss it there.  Do NOT have patches do multiple things.
