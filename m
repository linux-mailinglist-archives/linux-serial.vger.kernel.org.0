Yes, registering it based on the compatible might makes sense, but please 
see my comment below wrt. dw8250_check_lcr().

Then you're probably using some old kernel... Please base your work on 
tty repo's tty-next branch when working with serial upstream.

> And the total waiting time is not a const value so we need polling.

It's not constant, agreed. But your comment states that it's at most one 
frame worth of time so that should be the worst-case waiting time. Once 
the UART starts to do things like temporary switch to loopback and/or 
reinit/clearing FIFO, it doesn't seem that harmful to wait slightly 
longer for the worst-case frame time, so essentially you'd only need this 
(+ comment):

	p->serial_out(p, UART_MCR, up->mcr | UART_MCR_LOOP);
	dw8250_force_idle(p);
	ndelay(p->frame_time);
	p->serial_out(p, UART_LCR, up->lcr | UART_LCR_DLAB);

If you insist, ndelay() could be replaced by:
	ret = read_poll_timeout_atomic(p->serial_in, usr, !(usr & DW_UART_USR_BUSY),
				       1, DIV_ROUND_UP(p->frame_time, NSEC_PER_USEC), false,
				       p, d->usr_reg);

You also don't explain why force_idle() is needed inside to loop, why 
doing it once before the loop is not enough? I can see the need for that 
in loop for dw8250_check_lcr() because it doesn't enable loopback, but 
here, so why?

I started to wonder whether dw8250_check_lcr() should also temporarily 
switch to loopback mode to ensure the UART becomes idle. Some common macro 
could be created which wraps the idle forcing for both use cases + 
restoring LCR & MCR. That is, dw8250_force_idle() + little bit extra -> 
__dw8250_idle_enter() and __dw8250_idle_exit() that are called by the 
macro.

I also recall there was something with RS485 mode that it didn't do 
something with loopback but the wording in the databook seems rather 
vague.

So your patch doesn't work or what are you saying? I see you're using 
"before this patch" but how is that relevant to the case with the patch
my question was about, I don't understand?

Ah, I see. You should comment it then it's there just for safety purposes.


It might also make sense to add delayed error reporting for the failures. 
The error printing can safely happen only after releasing port's lock.
