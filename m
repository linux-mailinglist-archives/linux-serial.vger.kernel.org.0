Yeah IMO as per theory this should also be corrected but since you have 
already pulled out few experiment to prove garbage data issue(which I  
was suspecting) is not seen.

It's already consistent with existing logic and it behaves well 
practically . So the changes could be merge. Meanwhile I am checking 
with HW team to get clarity.

I assumed those as invalid bytes and don't wanted to read them so yeah 
dropping of bytes was expected.

Yeah I was expecting garbage data.

RX data first stored in RX_ASYNC_FIFO then it's transfered to RX_FIFO

When get_char is called and we observe 0 bytes in RX_FIFO, most probably 
data is not transfered from RX_ASYNC_FIFO to RX_FIFO.

BITS 27:25 of SE_GENI_RX_FIFO_STATUS register shows RX_ASYNC_FIFO word 
count.
