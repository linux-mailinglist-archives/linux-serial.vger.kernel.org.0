Okay, maybe the patch below will manage to filter the interesting part of 
it (not tested beyond compiling). It should capture a few irq events after 
the THRI is set when DMA Tx completes.

What I'd expect is to have iir value variation between the working and not 
working case. Especially, if it's UART_IIR_THRI that shows up that might 
be usable as a condition to return from handle_rx_dma() without touching
DMA Rx.
