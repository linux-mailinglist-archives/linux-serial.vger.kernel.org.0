Clarification: I support changing the default up to 16. It will avoid problems for most cases where
a) there are only a few Uartlites in the system
AND
b) the Kconfig user doesn't explictly specify SERIAL_UARTLITE_NR_UARTS

I just wanted to point out that trouble ensues when
a) somebody wants 16 Uartlites in a system when there is also a PS UART (basically any Zynq)
OR
b) somebody explicitly sets the SERIAL_UARTLITE_NR_UARTS to the number she built into a Zynq system
(when the Uartlite driver is activated in menuconfig, the NR parameters pops right up, so it's 
mighty tempting to actually set it to the accurate number)

Moving the default up should just not be a band-aid for the cases where a single Uartlite can not be 
assigned, when really there is a fundamental inconsistency between how serial_core.c has limited 
line numbering since Kernel 2.6 (0 <= line_id < NR_UARTs) and what Xilinx DTG does with UARTs.

Sincere apologies, I do not quite understand this explanation/argument. Would you be so kind to 
rephrase?

(As I'm a newbie to this list, I'm not sure how much back-and-forth is appropriate about a topic. 
Since my issue here is about the Xilinx DTG, not Linux kernel code per se, I'd also be fine to 
continue emailing off-list. There does not seem to be a similar list for device-tree-xlnx)

Best wishes,
Ruediger
