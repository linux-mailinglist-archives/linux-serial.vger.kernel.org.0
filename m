I got your point and I'm fully with. This caused me to print a warning
in Kernel log because it should not be the general working method.
In our special case we do not have any other option because the sensor
module using the SC16IS7xx and the hardware with the MCU running Linux OS
are fixed. We had no possibilities to move any GPIO or such. This was
the only chance  to support the dedicated sensor platform and I may be
the case that someone else faces the same problems. I thought that
someone else may benefit from this workaround too. But as I got your
point I'm also fine if it is not merged into main Linux Kernel sources.
