Hello Andy, thanks for reviewing!

Yes, I could understand that as well.

Not necessarily:
When on irqs are force-threaded, only a quick handler is called, returning 
IRQ_WAKE_THREAD, which is supposed to wake up the handler thread.

  * @IRQ_WAKE_THREAD:   handler requests to wake the handler thread

In this case (which is what I am dealing with), the actual handler will run 
in thread context (which I suppose don't disable IRQ for sched-out 
purposes).

That I am not aware about. I suppose it depends on driver implementation.

But if this one is correct, and must be true for every handler, then my 
first approach should be the right fix. See [1] below.


Below I am assuming handled IRQs = 'handlers which returned IRQ_HANDLED':

Sure

Not sure about this one as well.
You mean the ones that got queued for thread-handling, but somehow got 
paused since the interrupt got disabled?

If not, I guess once you disable an IRQ no interruption on that line happens,
so I don't think any interruption gets saved for later (at least not in 
kernel level).

But I may be wrong here, it's a guess.
