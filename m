No, I'm suggesting a hybrid approach.  Leave the interrupts enabled as
usual, but _also_ poll every 500 ms or 1 second (maybe make it
configurable?).  In some serial drivers (ones that hold the lock for
the whole interrupt routine) this polling function could actually be
the same as the normal interrupt handler so it'd be trivially easy to
implement and maintain.

NOTE: This is not the same type of polling that kgdb does today.  The
existing polling is really only intended to work when we're dropped
into the debugger.  This would be more like a "poll_irq" type function
that would do all the normal work the interrupt did and is really just
there in the case that the CPU that the interrupt is routed to is
locked up.

Maybe now it's clearer that there should be almost no overhead.  When
dealing with a SYSRQ it's fine if there's a bit of a delay before it's
processed, so polling every 1 second is probably fine.
