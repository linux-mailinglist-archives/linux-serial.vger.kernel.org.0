Digging a bit deeper: One issue of the original patch was definitely
that it tried to sanitized mctrl inside serial8250_do_set_mctrl, rather
than serial8250_set_mctrl. That caused alternative set_mctrl handler to
become out of sync /wrt mctrl. Just look at omap8250_set_mctrl, how it
will work on the unsanitized value.

That may or may not yet explain all issues Baocheng is seeing with the
patch.
