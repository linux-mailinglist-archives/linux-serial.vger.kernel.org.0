Hey don't forgot the important part!

Checking the code confirms this behavior. Grep for the macro
genpd_is_active_wakeup rather than GENPD_FLAG_ACTIVE_WAKEUP. It gets
used twice (suspend & resume), both in the same manner:

   if (device_wakeup_path(dev) && genpd_is_active_wakeup(genpd))

This means this flag won't have any impact on runtime PM handling of
power-domains. By the way, other users of the flag enable it at PD
registration & don't touch it afterwards.

There is currently nothing that links the runtime PM refcount to whether
or not the power-domains get powered-off at suspend_noirq. Should that
change? Maybe, but it would be a big behavioral change.
