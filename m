Hi Greg, Hi Ivan,

as would like to extend the RS485 behavior on my raspberry PI I did some "deep-diving" into the amba-pl011 driver and soon recognized the missing hardware support to detect "FIFO empty". Googling around I found the following patch, describing exactly my problem:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/20200107072831.GB1014453@kroah.com/T/

As I'm not familiar with your processes, I kindly ask you where I can find the patched sources of this Soft-Rs485-Amba driver and if it is planned to be intergrated in a future kernel release?

Bests
Jochen

Looking to the sources of amba-pl011.c I thought the "pl011_write"-function could be the right place to do so....but to be honest it seems not to work
