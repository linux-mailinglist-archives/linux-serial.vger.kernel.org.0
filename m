I tried to implement some naive solution, see below. I think that
it can be described as the 2nd layer of ownership.

It does not look that complicated. It might be because I used it only
in two paths which do the writing. And it is possible that it does
not work properly.

Then I got another idea. It might even easier.

I think that it might actually be enough to block the kthread when
any CPU is in emergency context, for example, by using a global
atomit counter.

There should not be problem with panic because
nbcon_context_try_acquire() fails on non-panic CPUs anyway.

I am going to try this approach.

Yup.

Good to know.

I am not sure if you already started working on it. I rather share
my naive ideas early so that I do not duplicate the effort.
It is possible that you have been there.

Anyway, here is POC of an API which blocks writing/flushing
in a context with a lower priority:

Subject: [POC] printk/nbcon: Allow to release console context after each
 record in atomic_flush

It gives nbcon_reacquire_nobuf() to acquire the ownership to clean up
the console after the interrupted write_thread() call and allow
to preempt the printk kthread.

Add an API to block writing/flushing messages in a context with
lower priority. Otherwise, it would start flushing a pending
message and get interrupted again by the higher priority context.

The API is used in both code paths which try to acquire the nbcon
console ownership and try to write a message using
nbcon_emit_next_record().

The priority field is set in nbcon unsafe context which
prevents takeovers. The context must not clear it after
loosing the console ownership.

Failure to reserve the flush priority is handled the same way
as a failure to get the context ownership. So, it might somehow
work.

Warning: This is just a POC. The code is not tested.

FIXME: The clearing of the flush priority is racy. It might
       clear a value set by another context when it was
       cleared by a higher priority context in the mean
       time.

       There are ways to fix it.

       But wait! It might be enough to synchronize normal vs. emergency
       context. Non-panic context won't be able to get
       the ownership anyway.
