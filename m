I still assert that old baud rate should never be "invalid". When it was 
set (earlier) through dz_set_termios(), it got validated and invalid 
ones were corrected. I think a valid baud rate in tty->termios is an 
invariant we just maintain on each call to dz_set_termios().

dz_encode_baud_rate() disallows 0 as baud rate. I don't understand what 
you're trying to say here.

This I kind of agree with but given the precondition where 0 baud rate is 
always rejected by dz_encode_baud_rate(), I don't think this scenario can 
materialize at all?
