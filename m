I don't see why not. You're basically just getting a resulting clock
that's not an integral "Hz", right?

So if "baud" is 9600 and sampling_rate is 16 then desired_clk is (9600
* 16) = 153600

Let's imagine that we do all the math and we finally decide that our
best bet is with the rate 922000 and a divider of 6. That means that
the actual clock we'll make is 153666.67 when we _wanted_ 153600.
There's no reason it needs to be integral, though, and 153666.67 would
still be better than making 160000.

Right, except that if you just pick the first clock you find it would
be _wildly_ off. I guess if you really want to do this the right way,
you need to set a maximum tolerance and pick the first rate you find
that meets that tolerance. Random web search for "uart baud rate
tolerance" makes me believe that +/- 5% deviation is OK, but to be
safe you probably want something lower. Maybe 2%? So if the desired
clock is within 2% of a clock you can make, can you just pick that
one?

Ah, sorry. Not quite 1 line, but this (untested)


freq = clk_round_rate(clk, mult);

if (freq % desired_clk == 0) {
 ser_clk = freq;
 best_div = freq / desired_clk;
 break;
}

candidate_div = max(1, DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST(freq, desired_clk));
candidate_freq = freq / candidate_div;
diff = abs((long)desired_clk - candidate_freq);
if (diff < best_diff) {
  best_diff = diff;
  ser_clk = freq;
  best_div = candidate_div;
}
