Yes. It just happens to not get hit at any of the standard baud rates 
that I found in the termbits.h files. So testing didn't find it until 
testing rates greater than what is allowed without the magic multiplier 
flag.
I found it when doing the math on 3000000 because that causes it with 
the 14 MHz crystal.
