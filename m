It's fine to perform such test case (and I have done myself many times similar
operations, but not against PNP UART). Anyway as Greg told you the device is gone
I'm not sure if there is any kernel version which ever worked with what you are
suggesting. What you need is to find a device in the sysfs which corresponds your
PNP UART and perform this against that device.

I have my examples in the script for non-PNP ones:

rebind() {
        local drvdir="/sys/bus/$1/drivers/$2"
        local devdir="/sys/bus/$1/devices/$3"
        [ -d "$drvdir" -a -d "$devdir" ] || return
        echo "$3" > "$drvdir/unbind"
        echo "$3" > "$drvdir/bind"
}

rebind platform 'dw-apb-uart'   '80860F0A:00'   # BYT ttyS1 (ACPI)
rebind platform 'dw-apb-uart'   '8086228A:00'   # BSW ttyS1 (ACPI)
rebind pci      '8250_mid'      '0000:00:04.2'  # Edison ttyS1
rebind pci      'intel-lpss'    '0000:00:18.1'  # BXT LH ttyS1
rebind pci      'intel-lpss'    '0000:00:1e.0'  # SKL ttyS1
rebind pci      '8250_lpss'     '0000:00:1e.3'  # BSW ttyS1 (PCI)
