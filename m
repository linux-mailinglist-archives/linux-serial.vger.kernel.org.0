Hi Greg,

thanks for your fast reply. I checked the sources you mentioned below, that helps a bit..

Could you please give me some more background what you mean with your question:
> You could do much the same in the pl011_rs485_tx_start() function when
> SER_RS485_RX_DURING_TX and SER_RS485_RTS_ON_SEND are checked, right?

Is there already a concept for RS485 drivers? ...or where to find "pl011_rs485_tx_start()"?

Bests
Jochen

Looking to the sources of amba-pl011.c I thought the "pl011_write"-function could be the right place to do so....but to be honest it seems not to work
