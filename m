That's intentional and documented in the following paragraph of the
commit message:

  Skip any invocation of ->set_mctrl() if RS485 is enabled.  RS485 has no
  hardware flow control, so the modem control lines are irrelevant and
  need not be touched.  When leaving RS485 mode, reset the modem control
  lines to the state stored in port->mctrl.  That way, UARTs which are
  muxed between RS485 and RS232 transceivers drive the lines correctly
  when switched to RS232.  (serial8250_do_startup() historically raises
  the OUT1 modem signal because otherwise interrupts are not signaled on
  ancient PC UARTs, but I believe that no longer applies to modern,
  RS485-capable UARTs and is thus safe to be skipped.)

I think that the Siemens IOT20x0 series muxes the UART between RS232
and RS485 transceivers, though I'm not sure if that applies both to
the contemporary AM6548-based IOT2050 and to the older Intel-based
machines.

In RS485 mode, the DTR signal should be completely irrelevant as
the transceiver is only attached to RX, TX and RTS pins.

When switching from RS485 to RS232 mode, the patch ensures that the
modem signals are reset to what's been saved in port->mctrl.  So DTR
will be raised once the UART is switched to RS232.

Thanks,

Lukas
