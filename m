Johan,

  On Windows I did not install a new driver. It was recognized by the system and uses the Microsoft provided Prolific driver Ver 3.8.38.2.

On windows everything looks fine (no sign of distress (i.e. no yellow caution triangle)).

Where should I look for the encoding (a8 a6 01 80 00 02 07) ? (110bd encodes as 80 00 C3 54 using the algorithm I described))

cheers,

   Michael
