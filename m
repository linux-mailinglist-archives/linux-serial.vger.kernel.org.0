Exactly my feeling.

This dependency does not make it impossible to build a single
kernel that supports multiple ARM64 systems.

Those "PLAT_*" symbols are not crazy.  They are needed to configure a
kernel for your specific hardware, leaving out support you don't need.
Not everyone has the hardware resources to run an allyesconfig kernel.

arm/multi_v7_defconfig and arm64/defconfig kernels are already booting
on multiple SoCs in upstream, and have done so for years.

Whether the dependency is present or not does not change this.

Not having the dependency means you will ask the user useless questions
when configuring his kernel.
My goal is to make kernel configuration easier, not more difficult.

No, because x86 is considered the golden standard ;-)

Dropping those dependencies is similar to always having a simple PCI
core without any host PCI bridges, dropping "depends on PCI" from all
PCI drivers, and building an all*config kernel for your old i386 that
predates PCI (you can replace PCI by ACPI to modernize the example).

What am I missing?!?
