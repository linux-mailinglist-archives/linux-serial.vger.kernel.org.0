Why does the hardware not follow the normal standard here?

And are you sure it will still not fit into the 8250 format?

You could, but it would be much smaller and easier to use the 8250
framework given that you probably do have an 8250-like device, right?

Let's see the code before we can give you any firm answers.

good luck!
