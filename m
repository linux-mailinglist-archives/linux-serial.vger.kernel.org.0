It's been on my list for a while.  I started it Friday but ran out of
time.  This week hasn't been going as smoothly as I hoped but I'll
prioritize this since it's been too long.

A bit of early feedback...

Although I'm not sure we can do Greg's "make it work everywhere
automatically", it's possible you could get half of your patch done
automatically.  Specifically, your patch really does two things:

a) It leaves the serial port "active" all the time to look for sysrq.
In other words even if there is no serial client it's always reading
the port looking for characters.  IMO this concept should be separated
out from the NMI concept and _could_ automatically work for all serial
drivers.  You'd just need something in the serial core that acted like
a default client if nobody else opened the serial port.  The nice
thing here is that we go through all the normal code paths and don't
need special cases in the driver.

b) It enables NMI for your particular serial driver.  This seems like
it'd be hard to do automatically because you can't do the same things
at NMI that you could do in a normal interrupt handler.

NOTE: to me, a) is more important than b) (though it'd be nice to have
both).  This would be especially true the earlier you could make a)
work since the main time when an "agetty" isn't running on my serial
port to read characters is during bootup.

Why is b) less important to me? Sure, it would let you drop into the
debugger in the case where the CPU handling serial port interrupts is
hung with IRQs disabled, but it _woudln't_ let you drop into the
debugger in the case where a different CPU is hung with IRQs disabled.
To get that we need NMI roundup (which, I know, you are also working
on for arm64).  ...and, if we've got NMI roundup, presumably we can
find our way into the debugger by either moving the serial interrupt
to a different CPU ahead of time or using some type of lockup detector
(which I know you are also working on for arm64).


One last bit of feedback is that I noticed that you didn't try to
implement the old "knock" functionality of the old NMI driver that's
being deleted.  That is: your new patches don't provide an alternate
way to drop into the debugger for systems where BREAK isn't hooked up.
That's not a hard requirement, but I was kinda hoping for it since I
have some systems that haven't routed BREAK properly.  ;-)


I'll try to get some more detailed feedback in the next few days.
