Yes.

DT-based drivers do not bind to a hardware-specific bus, and thus there
is no config symbol for a hardware-specific bus they can depend on.
Still, there are hardware classes, based on SoC vendors and SoC families.
Hence PLAT_FOO describes the latter.

There exist IP cores that are present on either PCI and non-PCI hardware.
With hardware-specific bus drivers, drivers for these need to implement
both a pci_driver and <some_other>_driver.  And they depend on PCI
|| <OTHER>.
With DT and ACPI, and device properties, a single platform_driver
needs to be written, just the matching is done differently. And there is
no "hard" (no "else the driver doesn't link") need for a hardware-specific
config-symbol dependency.  But it's still good to have one.

Defconfigs were the previous step, from an evolutionary point of view.
Arm64 has a single defconfig.  All dependencies must be expressed in
Kconfig.  I can take arm64/defconfig, remove support for other SoC families,
and I'll have a good kernel for my hardware, without bagage I don't need.
Without these dependencies, I have to remove lots and lots of drivers
I won't need.

If you want to compile drivers for hardware that cannot be present, use
COMPILE_TEST=y.
