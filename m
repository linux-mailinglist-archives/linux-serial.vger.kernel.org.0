Meanwhile reproduced myself, and now I believe your patch is broken in
ignoring the internal call path to serial8250_set_mctrl, coming from
uart_port_dtr_rts:

This case is not triggered by userspace setting a custom RTS value but
by the uart-internal machinery selecting it based on the rs485 mode,
among other things. That path must not be intercepted and made
conditional using the current MCR state but has to write the request
value *as is*. I think that is not even an omap-specific regression,
it's generic.

If you want to sanitize mctrl, you must do that at the entry point from
userspace, probably in uart_set_termios (but I didn't dig very deep into
that). So, reverting this commit still seems like the best option to me.

I see the point of filtering TIOCMSET, but that would have to be done
differently.
