Can you split this option out into a separate file so we don't have to
keep arguing about it, preventing the "real" early console code from
being merged?

I really think someone needs to go yell at some hardware engineers for
this issue.  How is this going to work for a "generic" arm64 kernel
image?  Your hardware always has to be self-describing for crazy stuff
like this.  Or you pass it in from the bootloader.  You can't hard-code
this thing, it defeats the whole idea of dynamic systems...
