Any character is "wrong", so picking this one feels odd.

Do we know when an underrun happens?  If so, handle that error.  If not,
well, something else is really wrong with this uart then (why are people
making new uarts still...)

But obviously it has otherwise you wouldn't have seen it, right?

Are you sure it will?  Constant memcopies should be really fast by the
compiler these days.

So this is a define that can never be changed?

Anyway, I don't know what to suggest here.  If this is something that
can happen, handle it properly.  If it can't, then why are we having
this discussion?  :)
