That means the RTS pin is always asserted and never deasserted.
I don't see how that could be related to the patch in question.
It's rather an indication that RS-485 is not enabled on the port.

And?  up->mcr is not used by the patch.  It retrieves the
current value of the RTS bit from the MCR register instead
of using the cached value in up->mcr.  And all it seeks to
achieve is *preserve* the current value of the RTS bit.
So I don't see why the cached value up->mcr is relevant here.

Thanks,

Lukas
