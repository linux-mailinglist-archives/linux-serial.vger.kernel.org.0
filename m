Please take a look at https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/4/9/576
("[PATCH v2 2/4] mfd: ioc3: Add driver for SGI IOC3 chip")

This is basically what I am trying to do.  I am just so unfortunate that
the serial devices I have are completely generic, so it does not make
sense for me to create a specialized 8250 driver.

Look at how the serial8250_ioc3_driver uses platform_get_resource() to
get the register memory, and how that works together with
mfd_add_devices() in the mfd driver.  Nice and elegant.  Standard
recommended approach for an mfd driver.
