Ok, here is a new log:

https://fedorapeople.org/~jwrdegoede/dmesg-8250-dma-issue-2

With one successful hci_uart probe and one failed. The failed one looks interesting:

[  576.808776] 8250irq: iir=cc lsr+saved=60 received=1/12 ier=0d dma_t/rx/err=0/1/0 cnt=-4
[  576.808870] Bluetooth: hci0: Frame reassembly failed (-84)

This is the only time that debug message shows anything but 0 for data received over dma. It looks like for all these small packets dma simply never kicks in and the extra IRQ from the THRI interrupt somehow starts a DMA transfer for the one byte and for some reason that DMA transfer always reads the byte as 0.

Note that the amount of received bytes is still correct, so the 1 byte transfer by DMA replaces one byte which would be otherwise read from MMIO (I guess its MMIO?), but it has the wrong (all bits 0) content.

Regards,

Hans
