Are these delays ever set to a value > 0 in practice?  struct serial_rs485
supports millisecond delays, but all RS485 transceivers I know of only
require delays in the microsecond or nanosecond range.  It was likely
a mistake that the delays were originally declared as millisecond values.
However we can't easily change that now because it's ABI and thus set in
stone.

E.g. the MAXM22510 has a "Driver Enable to Output" delay of 2.540 usec.
In practice no delay is necessary at all because the MMIO operations
performed by the driver take longer:

You're not seeing the conversion to threaded IRQ handling because it's
in separate commits on the above-linked branch, e.g.

serial: pl011: Use threaded interrupt for RX
https://github.com/RevolutionPi/linux/commit/4f3a6e9ea335

serial: pl011: Use threaded interrupt for TX
https://github.com/RevolutionPi/linux/commit/fae65b5a2c5b

I implemented threaded IRQ handling to maximize TX throughput
and minimize RX FIFO overruns at high baudrates.  Additionally,
threaded IRQ handling integrates more nicely with the realtime
patch set.  So the ability to simply use msleep() for rs485 delays
is merely a by-product.

The IRQ threads run at RT priority -50 with SCHED_FIFO policy just
as any other IRQ thread and user space may adjust that with chrt(1)
if desired.

Thanks,

Lukas
