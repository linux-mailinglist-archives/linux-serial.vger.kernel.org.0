Looking to the sources of amba-pl011.c I thought the "pl011_write"-function could be the right place to do so....but to be honest it seems not to work

Other drivers do this today, using gpio pins for this.  One example is
the drivers/tty/serial/ar933x_uart.c driver (look at the
ar933x_uart_tx_chars() function)

You could do much the same in the pl011_rs485_tx_start() function when
SER_RS485_RX_DURING_TX and SER_RS485_RTS_ON_SEND are checked, right?

As for making it "generic", I think there are other drivers that allow
the gpio pins to be selected as part of their device tree, look in the
drivers/tty/serial/ directory for the use of gpio values in lots of
different drivers.

hope this helps,
