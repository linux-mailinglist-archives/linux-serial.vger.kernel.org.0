Done.

Sure.

Yes, 0 is just rx/tx.  I've updated the comment to reflect that.

I've converted this to kernel-doc format and linked it to 
Documentation/trace/index.rst.  I've also documented the default values.

No, it just seemed easier to use the debugfs.  Not a good reason, I 
know.  I'll take a closer look at the tracefs for this.

Done.

I was using a 32-bit target and pahole didn't show any gaps. Does the 
pointer cause a gap on 64-bit targets?  In any case I moved the pointer 
to the top of the structure.

The spinlock protects the 'struct reg_queue' which can be accessed from 
interrupt context and normal context.  The mutex protects the outer data 
structure which only the user accesses so it doesn't need to disable 
interrupts.  I moved the spinlock to the reg_queue to make this more 
explicit.

I changed it to 28 which is just enough to hold the 26-character 
register event string + newline + NUL.

I generally keep functions in alphabetical order and choose names 
accordingly so they are grouped the way I want.  For example, the 
queue_xxx() functions are the only ones that touch the reg_queue 
structure.  I use forward declarations (whether needed or not) to avoid 
compiler errors regardless of the function order.  Is this a bad practice?

Can you clarify the functionality you are suggesting?  Is it the mcount 
call inserted by the compiler for function tracing?  I guess I need to 
get more familiar with the kernel tracing facility to make a comparison 
but maybe you could point me in the right direction?

Can you point me to the structures you have in mind?  One thought is 
that I have a 'wrap' flag which is a little paranoid but it ensures that 
a buffer overflow is detected.

Thanks for your review!  I've created another patch that incorporates 
most of your suggestions and I'll post that next. I'll also spend some 
more time looking at the tracefs to address your other suggestions.
