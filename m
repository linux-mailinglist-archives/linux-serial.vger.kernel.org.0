Each IRQ can be disabled on both sides: device side, host side. I think we are
talking about host side here as IRQ code doesn't know about each and every devices.
Am I right? Then host side of device IRQ is disabled by core and it doesn't prevent
scheduling from happening (of course if it's UP system with nohz fully on, it might
be that this IRQ is the only one to schedule the system, but I don't see any other
way out here).

At least this is how I interpret the 81e2073c175b ("genirq: Disable interrupts
for force threaded handlers"). Maybe that I'm missing something obvious here...

This is just an expectation and some drivers proven to loose performance if
they don't follow it:

0b60557230ad ("usb: ehci: Prevent missed ehci interrupts with edge-triggered MSI")

I believe it depends if IRQ is level or edge triggered. For level triggered
we may stuck for a while in the handler if there is a stream of IRQs, hence
driver may deliberately give up to give other tasks a chance to progress.

If it's edge triggered, we may loose it if it's not get replayed.

There is a mechanism for IRQ replay in the kernel, see IRQS_REPLAY and code
around it.
