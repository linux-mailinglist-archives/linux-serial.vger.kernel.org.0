I have done further testing with the patch below in place.  Unfortunately
the PC with the real serial port decided not to boot, so instead I'm testing
with a 3-wire null modem cable into a PL2303-based USB-serial converter on
another box running a 5.15.38 kernel.  Flow control was turned off since the
cable wasn't wired for that.

Tests done in minicom:

 * Speed: change from 115200 to 38400 and back again.

   The speed setting of the CH341 appears to work correctly.

 * Data length: change from 8 to 7 bits in minicom on both adapters

   CH341 = 8 bits, PL2303 = 8 bits
    - Data delivered correctly in both directions.

   CH341 = 8 bits, PL2303 = 7 bits
    - Data sent by the CH341 received correctly by the PL2303
    - Data sent by the PL2303 not received correctly by the CH341

   CH341 = 7 bits, PL2303 = 7 bits
    - Data sent by the CH341 received correctly by the PL2303
    - Data sent by the PL2303 not received correctly by the CH341

   CH341 = 7 bits, PL2303 = 8 bits
    - Data delivered correctly in both directions.

   There are too many variables in play to know what to make of this given
   that the response of the PL2303 driver to these changes is unknown.  At
   first glance the results appear to be rather inconsistent.  Maybe the
   data length setting is not always affecting tx and rx on one or both of
   the adapters.

 * Parity: change from None to Even.

   Changing only one adapter to Even parity did not prevent data being
   received correctly.  Data continued to be received correctly when both
   were set to even parity.

 * Stop bits: change from 1 to 2.

   All combinations of stop bit settings resulted in correct delivery of
   data in both directions.

I'm not sure what this proves: most of these settings don't appear to be
having any effect on either adapter.  In the end, 8N1 works and this is,
after all, what most people would be using.  The situation with the patch is
clearly better than it was without the patch because the CH341 is now
delivering data in a timely manner - just like it did under 4.4.14.

The behaviour of the LCR setting on version 0x27 may not be a new thing: all
my applications use 8N1, so if any of the other combinations were faulty
under 4.4.14 I wouldn't know.  I may look into testing the LCR settings
under 4.4.14 if you think there's value in it.  I expect it will show that
the patch below restores the 4.4.14 behaviour for hardware version 0x27, and
that the LCR issues were present in 4.4.14 but masked due to the almost
universal use of 8N1).  I can also try to work out an alternative way to
get a real hardware serial port if that would help: I'm thinking it would
remove any doubt about the LCR setting at one end of the link.
