I've incorporated ideas from my patch and yours into a v4 patchset of
the original series.  Note that I didn't include your earlycon
deferral patchset [1] in my series which means it'll need to be
rebased.  Hopefully this is OK since I think the rebase will be easy,
but yell if you want an extra pair of eyes on it.
