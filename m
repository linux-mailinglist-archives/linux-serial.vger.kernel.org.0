That, however, is unfortunately not the case I was interested in here. The 
code does restart the timer if new characters _were received_ (residue 
changed), no? So my request for clarification to the changelong still 
stands, why is rearming the timer necessary instead of simply setting a 
longer timeout right from the start?

(In the first paragraph, you stated the problem is about timer triggering 
prematurely with low baud rates.)

This is not to say that the new approach is wrong but the changelog fails 
to explain all facets of what is wrong with the old approach adequately.

Okay. You might also find CIRC_CNT_TO_END() useful in those inner 
functions to calculate the length before the wrap.

What about this part? If the transfer always does n chars, the left over 
residue can match spuriously for the new transfer and trigger the copy 
because last and current residue happen to match (kinda by chance but 
could be simply due to repetitive transfer pattern)?

Yes, please use ->frame_time. I added it exactly to allow this kind of 
calculations to be easily based on actual frame timing (the other 
questions were just to gauge if I understood right what is behind your 
math).
