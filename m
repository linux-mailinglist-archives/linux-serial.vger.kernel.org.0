Odds are, this is already an ioctl for the tty layer given that this
seems like a common thing even for "normal" uarts.  Has anyone looked?

Again, that should already be an option we support, if not, I would be
surprised.  I don't have the time to dig through the
kernel/documentation at the moment, but if someone that cares about this
can, I would appreciate it :)
