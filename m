In Documentation/driver-api/serial/tty.rst, there are duplicated texts
about some struct tty_ldisc_ops' hooks. Combine them into existing
kernel-doc comments of struct tty_ldisc_ops and drop them from the
Documentation/.

 Line Discipline Methods
 -----------------------
 
-TTY side interfaces
-^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
-
-======================= =======================================================
-open()			Called when the line discipline is attached to
-			the terminal. No other call into the line
-			discipline for this tty will occur until it
-			completes successfully. Should initialize any
-			state needed by the ldisc, and set receive_room
-			in the tty_struct to the maximum amount of data
-			the line discipline is willing to accept from the
-			driver with a single call to receive_buf().
-			Returning an error will prevent the ldisc from
-			being attached. Can sleep.
-
-close()			This is called on a terminal when the line
-			discipline is being unplugged. At the point of
-			execution no further users will enter the
-			ldisc code for this tty. Can sleep.
-
-hangup()		Called when the tty line is hung up.
-			The line discipline should cease I/O to the tty.
-			No further calls into the ldisc code will occur.
-			Can sleep.
-
-read()			(optional) A process requests reading data from
-			the line. Multiple read calls may occur in parallel
-			and the ldisc must deal with serialization issues.
-			If not defined, the process will receive an EIO
-			error. May sleep.
-
-write()			(optional) A process requests writing data to the
-			line. Multiple write calls are serialized by the
-			tty layer for the ldisc. If not defined, the
-			process will receive an EIO error. May sleep.
-
-flush_buffer()		(optional) May be called at any point between
-			open and close, and instructs the line discipline
-			to empty its input buffer.
-
-set_termios()		(optional) Called on termios structure changes.
-			The caller passes the old termios data and the
-			current data is in the tty. Called under the
-			termios semaphore so allowed to sleep. Serialized
-			against itself only.
-
-poll()			(optional) Check the status for the poll/select
-			calls. Multiple poll calls may occur in parallel.
-			May sleep.
-
-ioctl()			(optional) Called when an ioctl is handed to the
-			tty layer that might be for the ldisc. Multiple
-			ioctl calls may occur in parallel. May sleep.
-
-compat_ioctl()		(optional) Called when a 32 bit ioctl is handed
-			to the tty layer that might be for the ldisc.
-			Multiple ioctl calls may occur in parallel.
-			May sleep.
-======================= =======================================================
-
-Driver Side Interfaces
-^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
-
-======================= =======================================================
-receive_buf()		(optional) Called by the low-level driver to hand
-			a buffer of received bytes to the ldisc for
-			processing. The number of bytes is guaranteed not
-			to exceed the current value of tty->receive_room.
-			All bytes must be processed.
-
-receive_buf2()		(optional) Called by the low-level driver to hand
-			a buffer of received bytes to the ldisc for
-			processing. Returns the number of bytes processed.
-
-			If both receive_buf() and receive_buf2() are
-			defined, receive_buf2() should be preferred.
-
-write_wakeup()		May be called at any point between open and close.
-			The TTY_DO_WRITE_WAKEUP flag indicates if a call
-			is needed but always races versus calls. Thus the
-			ldisc must be careful about setting order and to
-			handle unexpected calls. Must not sleep.
-
-			The driver is forbidden from calling this directly
-			from the ->write call from the ldisc as the ldisc
-			is permitted to call the driver write method from
-			this function. In such a situation defer it.
-
-dcd_change()		Report to the tty line the current DCD pin status
-			changes and the relative timestamp. The timestamp
-			cannot be NULL.
