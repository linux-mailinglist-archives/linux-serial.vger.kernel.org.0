Emulated in what way?

That's a crazy api, why not just use configfs so you do not have to
parse long strings in the kernel?  That is exactly what configfs was
created for.

And you are just creating a "fake" tty device, how is that going to be
used to test anything?  There's no hardware attached to it, are you just
talking about testing userspace programs?

Again, please use configfs.

And document this all somewhere really really really good, in the kernel
tree.

Please no new module parameters, this is not the 1990's. :)

If you really want those permissions on your sysfs files, then set them
to those values in your kernel code.

But I really doubt you want those permissions on them, that's really
wide open.

We can handle strings, right?  Why all of the numbers?

Why is this a separate sysfs file?

This all feels really odd, what is this going to be used for?
