This is the main point of this patch. The codepoint space got shortened in Unicode at some point between v3.0 (1999) and v4.0 (2003). The reason why is expressed by the first sentence in the commit msg. The affected functions validate input coming into the subsystem from the user, which makes it a red flag that they do not do so correctly (i.e., according to a generally accepted standard). As they stand, these functions are a potential source of compatibility and security issues. The may not be a bomb, they may be a time bomb.

Note how very old the old parsing algorithm is. I made a quick grep of the kernel source for tell-tale signs of utf8 parsing to see if there's any other place where the old algorithm is still being used. I found none, and I found these which do the 0x10ffff limiting (I didn't check the "noncharacters" handling):

fs/unicode/mkutf8data.c
fs/unicode/utf8-norm.c
fs/udf/unicode.c
fs/nls/nls_base.c (has many users outside fs/)
drivers/tty/vt/keyboard.c

I didn't check, but I have no doubt that Perl implements Unicode correctly as well.

Currently, the two affected functions mark these codepoints as invalid by substituting them with the placeholder U+FFFD. After the patch, U+FFFE and U+FFFF are treated as ordinary valid codepoints.

Let me point out that I've never seen a utf8 validator where "noncharacters" were treated in a special way. Of course, there're only so many validator implementations that I have seen. Checking for iswprint()-ability is common, but that's something very different. IMHO, the validator in vt.c is not a place to pay any special regard to "noncharacters".

This is mostly answered above. I don't work with the kernel in a developer capacity. I found this parsing error by accident while researching some CONFIG options. I'm not qualified to say that this patch won't break anything and it would take me an abhorrent amount of time to verify that to a reasonable degree. I don't write code for kbd or other console-related userspace tools either. I ran the patched kernel for a while, played around with fonts and various TUI utilities. I found no issues. The red flag, which I talked about earlier, was _the_ reason I submitted my patch.

Ok, patch v4 coming up with this removed and I'll take care of it in a subsequent submission. That'll be one truly trivial commit, though.
