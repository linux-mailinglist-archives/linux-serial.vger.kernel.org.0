It would be best if you test with this tree:

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/tty.git

and use the branch named "tty-next".

interrupt line stays high with the use of a voltmeter.

Ok, so I assume that the line stays high at all times, not just after 2
minutes?

Once IRQ# goes high, the MAX14830 is ready to be programmed. The MODE1[7]: IRQSel bit should then be set to enable normal IRQ# interrupt operation.

This is supposed to be done automatically by the driver in
max310x_probe(), so it should have no effect to redo it manually.

Based on that (and clock-frequency property), I assume that your clock
is a crystal of 3.686400 MHz?

Ok, now I see that you are using 5 MAX14830 ICs, and it seems that the
crystal is only connected to the first IC, and the other 4 remaining
ICs are supposed to be clocked from the first?

If it is like this, the driver doesn't currently support this mode of
operation. The driver do not access the register TxSynch at address $20
at all, so the bit 7 CLKtoGPIO is always set to its default value of
0...


> Kindly let me know of any ideas that we could try further.

I think it would be best to focus on making only the first MAX14830
device to work, before trying to have all 5 running at the same time,
since you are using a special mode of interconnecting the chips, and
this mode is 

So I would suggest to temporary remove in your
DTS the entries for the 4 last ICs, and keep only the first one. Then
try to make it work properly.

Ok, the comment certainly seems a little bit confusing, I will try to
look into it. Thank you.
