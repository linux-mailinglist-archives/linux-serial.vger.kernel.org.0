 If the old baud rate in termios was invalid, then we would just resort to 
9600 baud, so I wouldn't be concerned here as we need to set the baud rate 
to something anyway.  My only concern is whether `tty_termios_baud_rate' 
can ever return 0 for `old_termios', which would of course never happen 
with `uart_get_baud_rate'.

 But new code seems to me to be doing the right thing anyway.  That is if 
we're getting out of a hangup (which we don't currently handle with the 
modem lines anyway, but that's quite a different and complex matter) with 
an invalid baud rate, then we'll fail to encode it, then fail to encode 0, 
and finally resort to 9600 baud and write it back to `termios'.  So we'll 
get out of a hangup with a baud rate different to one requested, but that 
is as much as we can do in that case: we have fulfilled the request the 
best we could and `uart_get_baud_rate' would set the rate to 9600 baud 
anyway.

 Given the observation above I have acked your patch.  Perhaps you could 
put some of the analysis above into the change description.
