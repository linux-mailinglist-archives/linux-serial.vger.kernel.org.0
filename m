DTG is out of scope of linux-serial mailing list that's why I am not 
going to comment it here.

And we should strictly talk about the patch itself here but I think Greg 
should give us his thoughts on it if make sense to use free ID instead 
of ID which user specifically asking for.

And before I list options we should likely deprecate DT port-number 
property completely.

We should use DT serial alias ID for port assignment and if it is above 
or NR_PORTs just fail.

If there is no alias ID
1) you can find free ID and use it (your patch)
2) you can use the highest alias (the best for the same IP type) and use it
3) you can generate it at run time (but it was reverted from ps uart in 
past)

Thanks,
