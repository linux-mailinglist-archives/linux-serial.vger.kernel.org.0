Why do you have 2 different versions?  Why not merge them both into the
kernel tree?  That seems like madness to try to support 2.  And why
would we care about any out-of-tree code?  This is increasing our
complexity for code that isn't even being merged here, not anything you
would do if you were the maintainer of it, right?

Then submit the code for that here please.

Please submit the code that depends on this change, and we will be glad
to review it.
