Wouldn't that mean that you can't use a generic Alpha kernel on the Jensen
anymore? CONFIG_ALPHA_JENSEN is only set if you specifically select the
Jensen as target, not when you build a generic kernel. That would be a step
back in my opinion, as the Debian generic kernel from debian-ports did
as least boot up on real hardware and the serial console worked just fine
[granted, the EISA cards were not detected, even after support for it
got enabled, but that's another case of worms].

Unfortunately I still can't boot my Jensen with a self-build kernel (that
it's the only Alpha without netboot makes it only harder), so
I can't even test your patch, but my plan is to get it booting over
my xmas vacation :-)

CU,
Uli
