See e.g. 4f4e670342b14f302e17c93bd22fc943bbaaf1de. I guess you could argue 
since FIFO is not just cleared at that point but also disabled it won't 
trigger that particular problem but I'd prefer to not depend on that given 
I'd want moving into the direction where the unnecessary looking FIFO 
disable does not occur (as was discussed below).

Yes, but I'd expect clear fifos to be no-op when FIFO is not enabled so 
it's better IMHO.

Thanks foy your thoughts on this. Maybe I'll spend the time to dig through 
all the related history about it to see if there's something interesting 
to find.
