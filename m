Thanks, I understand now. I see three patterns shared by serial drivers:

1. Do not take the lock in console_write() handler,
2. Take the lock like:
if (port->sysrq)
    locked = 0;
else if (oops_in_progress)
    locked = spin_trylock_irqsave(&port->lock, flags);
else
    spin_lock_irqsave(&port->lock, flags)

3. Take the lock like above but preceded with local_irq_save().

It seems the choice of pattern depends which driver was used as a base.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
