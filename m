Right.

Thanks for the explanation and the reproducer program. I tried yesterday
to install a recent Linux-Alpha distribution on any of my Alphas to
be able to build natively and check my self-build kernels before burning
a CD-ROM, but I failed. Neither gentoo nor Debian nor T2 was installable on
my Miatas (the Personal Workstations) or my Avanti (AlphaStation 400),
either failing to boot or recognizing the disks or the CD-ROM, or switching
to a framebuffer which did not work or just dying on the hardware detection.
That was a bit frustrating, but I have to follow plan B now and do cross-builds
from amd_x64 to Alpha - that's easy for the kernel (infact, that's what
I've been doing from the start), but generating something bootable that
way is a challenge and needs more time than I usually have during the week,
but I will tackle it over my xmas vacation,

CU,
Uli
