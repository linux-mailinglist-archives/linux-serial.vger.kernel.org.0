I'm testing this by booting directly from RPi4's bootloader. And it
works as long as I add this to config.txt:

enable_uart=3D1
gpu_freq=3D500

Which AFAIK blocks frequency scalin on the GPU and fixes the clock to a
point where the serial is set at 115200 bauds.

Ideally it'd be nice to be able to query the clock frequency, and
recalculate the divisors based on that. But I don't know if it's
feasible at that point in the boot process.

We could maybe leave a comment explaining what is expected from the
bootloader, given the different options around.

Nicolas
