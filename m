Thanks for confirming. Then this sounds like something which Prolific
should be very well aware of.

That was the encoding used by Joe's device (same driver I think) for
110n81.

It may not work with your device, but 0x10000 could just be a
2-prescaler bit:

	32 * 12*10^6 / (2 * 0x6a8 * 4^5) = ~110.03521126760563380282

where as you would have:

	32 * 12*10^6 / (0x354 * 4^6) = ~110.03521126760563380282

Could you try hardcoding 0x1a6a8 and and see if you end up with 110 bd?
