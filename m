Sure. I'll try. It's always a tradeoff between providing too much
information and not providing enough. In general I find that providing
the thought process can help someone else who is likely going to go
through the same thing as they're trying to understand the patch, but
I agree it can also be overwhelming.

Sure. I've attempted to use the imperative tone when possible. In
general (unless my understanding is flawed) it's not possible to use
imperative when explaining to the reader how the hardware/driver works
or what the problem is and (IMO) we shouldn't fully remove these types
of explanations from the commit message. When describing what the
patch actually does, though, I've tried to make sure it's in
imperative form. If you have wording changes on v3 then please suggest
specific changes.
