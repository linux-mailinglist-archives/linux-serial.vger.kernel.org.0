Using the patch below, the device appears to function correctly: characters
are echoed back to minicom as soon as they are sent and the first characater
is not lost.  Changing line speed in minicom does not result in a lost
character either.

Of course all testing to this point has been with a loopback adapter which
means there's no indication whether line speed (or any other LCR parameters)
have really changed.  For complicated reasons I can't easily test using the
programmer hardware right now.  I will see if I can work out a way to verify
speed and LCR changes with the hardware I have available.  Hacking up a
null-modem cable and connecting to a PC which happens to have a real
hardware serial port may be the easiest.
