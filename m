UARTS with UART_CAP_EFR activates auto-RTS with UART_EFR_RTS and that is
not used anywhere. Setting this bit fixes my problem.

I can read the EFR register before using it (it was simply cleared before).
But then I change things for the XR17V35x too. But I donâ€™t want to touch
that one because this UART has UART_CAP_AFE set and tries to set
auto-RTSCTS in two places. But someone with access to that hardware should
take a look, it seems it has the same problems. No auto-RTS and enhanced
mode is disabled in set_termios().

I think the code below is the safest way. It fixes things I can test
and does not change anything else.

summary for reviewers:

1. this patch keeps the enhanced mode activated for the 16C950 instead
of deactivating it in set_termios(). 
2. it activates auto-RTS for the 16C950
3. reenables UART_CAP_EFR for the 16C950 because of fix 1 and 2
