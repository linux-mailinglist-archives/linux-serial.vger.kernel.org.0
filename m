It took me a little while, but I finally see what you're saying.
You're saying that we keep calling into the boot console even though
it's no longer in the list of consoles.  Then we temporarily disable
the boot console's exit routine until kgdb_earlycon() is done.  (side
note: the exit routine was recently added and probably most consoles
don't use it).

OK, that doesn't seem totally insane.  It actually works OK for you?

It's probably at least worth a warning in the log if we detect that
we're using the boot console and it's not in the console list anymore.
Then if kgdb starts misbehaving someone might have a clue.

If your solution is OK we might also want to remove the call to
cleanup_earlycon_if_invalid() in configure_kgdboc() too.

I think you might win the "hackiest solution" prize, but your solution
definitely does seem better because I can't think of any other good
way to handle people whose consoles register a long time before their
tty.  ;-)
