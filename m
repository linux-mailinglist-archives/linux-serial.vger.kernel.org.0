It's a bit odd because BUSY should indicate a character is being received 
(asserted around middle of the start bit according to the databook), not 
that it was pushed to FIFO. Is it trying to indicate BUSY due to rxing 
another character but then the hypothesis that enabling loopback takes at 
most 1 frame would be false.

To understand better what's going on here during debugging, it might be 
useful the check DR in LSR in the case when the BUSY is still held to 
exclude data-in-RBR condition which is another condition that could 
assert BUSY. Since the FIFO is being toggled off/on, there's window of 
time when BUSY could be held due to something arriving into RBR.

IMHO, it would be nice if the FIFO reset turns out to be entirely 
unnecessary for enforcing not-busy because of that very window of 
receiving something into RBR. A character in RBR would need to be handled 
by an extra read from UART_RX which is what dw8250_force_idle() actually 
does, it looked earlier pretty magic to me but now realizing this race 
window w/o FIFO, maybe that's the explanation. If FIFO reset is not 
necessary, it would take away the need to understand how instanteneous 
toggling UART_FCR_ENABLE_FIFO is wrt. arriving character.

Is Tx side empty during your test or can it interfere too here? (Just 
thinking out loud, you probably considered that yourself).

I checked it briefly yesterday and only the break_ctl would need to be 
wrapped besides set_divisor and set_termios. In any case, it should be 
done in a separate patch but definitely looked doable.
