The application is connecting newly developed sensors(with only rf interface) and legacy sensors(with regular serial communication over rs-485 with modbus) keeping the legacy user software.

User sw [Java]
	<-> /dev/ttyXXX
		<-> si4455[driver]
			<-> si4455[hardware]
				<---air---> new device[si4455+ARM Cortex-M0] 1
					+-> new device[si4455+ARM Cortex-M0] 2
					+-> new device[si4455+ARM Cortex-M0] n
					+-> gateway[si4455+ARM Cortex-M0]<---RS485--> Legacy device 1
										  +-> Legacy device 2
										  +-> Legacy device n

I think this driver could be a good solution in a lot off applications where the user wants to change from wired to wireless with this(Si4455) device, without changing the user sw.
Using sub GHz transport is better because the band below GHz is less loaded than Wifi or bluetooth.

Thanks to suggestions, I can remove unnecessary ioctl calls as well. This way, it remains fully compatible with user software and does not need to be hacked.
