Yes, I know how it's used. It's the ugliest hack in the serial support in L=
inux.
Telling that baud rate is 38400 and supplying something completely differen=
t,
non-standard stuff.

And again, how does it differ from BOTHER paths (except being a hack)?
You supply baud rate with 1 baud granularity and program hardware
registers accordingly. (Yes, I remember you pointed out the sub-HZ
frequencies, but I don't buy it as a very good argument because the
only significant error can be achieved at baud rates under the 100).

It's a pity. But what support code needs the SPD_CUST nowadays?

I had had this in my plans [2] but suddenly I had no time to accomplish it.=

I believe that for these years spd_cust shouldn't be used at all. OK,
it seems the first thing we may do is to patch the user space to give
a fat warning that spd_cust is deprecated and should be avoided.
And... it seems already there [3].

I see your point. My question here, does this series extend SPD_CUST
to additional (newly supported?) baud rates? If so, I would be against
that extension. Supporting deprecated stuff is okay for a while.

To the end of the discussion may be good to read also these [4] and [5]

Tell me how to look into git logs without cloning a repository (I
think it's possible through some borken web UI somehow, but never
heard about it). In any case, either in the commit message or in the
code it will be in the repo, so not a big deal to me after all.

Yeah, it seems it has never worked before.

To me any folder is more or less okayish as long as it's there, under
the Documentation :-)
