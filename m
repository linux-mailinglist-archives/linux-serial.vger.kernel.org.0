Not really, if you have control over the fpga firmware (and odds are you
do), just fix that and instantly your device works with all kernels, no
need to change anything.

Why not do this?

As this hardware will not work on any operating system as-is, why not
fix the firmware to keep from having to support a one-off device that no
one else would be crazy enough to create?  :)
