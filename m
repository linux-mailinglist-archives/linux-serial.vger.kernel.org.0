Ok, so at least that addresses the disabled TX timer.

What happens if you change the line speed? Does the first character
after changing speed also get dropped?

There were a few more changes done to the initialisation sequence at
that time and more changes in this area has followed since.

Could you try the patch below which addresses the disabled tx timer and
restores one of the init commands that were removed in 4.10.

If that doesn't help, we'll keep digging. One more thing to try then
could be to comment out the above line on a 4.10 kernel to rule the
impact of any later changes on the first lost character.

Interesting. The devices I have here both have version 0x30. While the
tx-timer bit has no effect on the CH340G it must be set on the CH341A in
order for the FIFO to empty before it is full.

Michael Hanselmann posted a patch mentioning that devices before 0x30
has never been supported by the mainline driver:

	2c509d1cc86d ("USB: serial: ch341: name prescaler, divisor registers")

but your programmer seems to suggest otherwise, even if there may be
other differences here left to account for.

The joys of reverse-engineering...

Subject: [PATCH] USB: serial: ch341: fix disabled tx timer on older devices

At least one older CH341 appears to have the TX timer enable bit
inverted so that setting it disables the TX timer and prevents the FIFO
from emptying until it is full.

Only set the TX timer enable bit for devices with version newer than
0x27.

Also try restoring an older init command before updating the line
settings to see if it has any effect on a lost first byte after
initialisation.
