Oh yes, please!

That would mean I can create ttyS2 and upward while keeping ttyPS0 and 
ttyPS1 (which invaded the serial<N> alias namespace) at the lower 
numbers.

It is hard to make predictable numbers with the backward operating 
serial<N> aliases in the device tree. It makes relations in the wrong 
direction.

If a system has two ttyPS<N> uarts (xilinx_uartps) and needs them at 
ttyPS0 and ttyPS1 (or at least <=ttyPS9, due to another bug in 
start_getty) and 10 ttyS<N> (8250) you can configure the kernel for 10 
8250 devices and give 8 of them the predictable ttyS2 to ttyS9. The last 
two will get the remaining ttyS0 and ttyS1. You cannot assign them their 
number, because the serial0 and serial1 alias are required for the 
ttyPS0 and ttyPS1.

However with this option it would be possible to configure for 12 8250 
devices and not use nor see ttyS0 and ttyS1.

The best option would of course be to not even instantiate kernel 
drivers for non-existing devices.
