A wild guess: make sure you don't use Linux kernel console on serial
port, i.e., /proc/consoles is empty. Serial console may disable
interrupts for very long time intervals due to kernel printk()
implementation.

I've got random data loss on serial ports when turning on and off WiFi
on my board (that caused some printk() diagnostic from the kernel) due
to this deficiency. Took ages to isolate.
