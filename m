 I have implemented the calculation using parameters from original OxSemi 
datasheets and verified this code across three architectures available to 
me (POWER9, RISC-V, 32-bit x86) and a couple of cards made by different 
manufacturers connected to a non-OxSemi serial device each at the other 
end.  I have checked the usual baud rates of up to 460800bps.  Higher baud 
rates work too, though I could only try them between OxSemi devices, so 
actual rates were not verified for correctness.

 And offhand I can say it works just fine at 230400bps with 6.0.0-rc2 as 
at commit 10d4879f9ef0 and my RISC-V machine (using an EXSYS EX-44171 
1S+1P port PCIe option card, built around the OXPCIe952 too) talking to a 
remote console server in my lab.  I don't have an oscilloscope available 
to check actual waveforms produced.

 A bug can never be ruled out.  I doubt that Delock would use a fake chip 
or indeed that anyone would choose to clone an OxSemi part, which seems 
fairly complex to me for a serial port.

 The problem is the original calculation is inaccurate enough for the 
serial interface not to communicate correctly at higher baud rates.  I 
found setting two stop bits while talking to a remote end that has one 
stop bit set a possible workaround for some cases, but why not do the 
calculation correctly in the first place?

 If you're willing to debug it, then I'll be more than happy to supply you 
with diagnostic patches, some of which I made in the development of the 
fix.  Also what processor architecture do you use the interface with?
