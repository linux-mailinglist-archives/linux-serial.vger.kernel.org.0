I did use git send-email to send the patches. I have successfully used the
git send-email tool to send a series of patches before, and that series was
later merged into 6.18-rc1. Therefore, I feel that my usage of git send-email
should not be an issue. The only difference of my current submission is that
after sending each patch with git send-email, I waited for the patches to
appear on lkml.org before sending the next one. I had encountered issues before
where sending multiple patches in a row caused only some of them to appear on
lkml.org, with others taking a long time to show up. That's why I specifically
decided to wait a bit after each patch this time. I'm really not sure why the
system didn't group my three patches together; it's quite puzzling to me.

Our system is indeed RT-Linux, version 6.1.146-rt53. Our project has been
ongoing for about 2 years, and we hadn't paid close attention to these jitter
issues before. It is only recently that we needed to focus on them specifically.

If user-configurable CPUs are really needed for queueing, do you have any
recommendations on how to implement this? Would it be appropriate to create
a new node under /sys/devices/platform/serial8250/tty/ttyS*?
As mentioned earlier, our system is an RT-Linux system. As you say that
using an RT kernel may not encounter this issue, are you implying that RT-Linux
has priority inheritance logic? However, the logic within work items isn't
always protected by locks. Even if everything is under lock protection, when a
work item starts executing and hasn't yet entered the lock, it can still be
preempted by real-time tasks. In an RT-Linux system, such preemption of kworker
by real-time tasks is more common compared to a standard kernel.

If possible, I will later add a node to separately configure each tty/ttyS*
device. The approach I intend to use is to add this tty_flip_cpu node under
/sys/devices/platform/serial8250/tty/ttyS*. Is it OK?
Based on our project, the DMA RX complete events for tty are almost evenly
distributed across each core. I believe it is necessary to increase the
flexibility of the queue_work to be located on a specific CPU, as it is difficult
to predict whether a core is running many long-duration real-time tasks based on
the driver code or low-level logic strategy.
