Speaking about weak design of a SoC' clock tree. Our problems are nothing
with respect to the Allwinner SoC, in which case of changing the
CPU-frequency may cause the UART glitches subsequently causing data
transfer artefacts.) Moreover as I can see the same issue may raise for
I2C, QSPI, PWM devices there.

Anyway your concern does make sense.

Yes, your solution is also possible, but even in case of stopping Tx/Rx it
doesn't lack drawbacks. First of all AFAIK there is no easy way to just
pause the transfers. We'd have to first wait for the current transfers
to be completed, then somehow lock the port usage (both Tx and Rx
traffic), permit the reference clock rate change, accordingly adjust the
UART clock divider, and finally unlock the port. While if we don't mind
to occasionally have UART data glitches, we can just adjust the UART ref
divider synchronously with ref clock rate change as you and SiFive UART
driver suggest.

So we are now at a zugzwang - a fork to three not that good solutions:
1) lock the whole clock branch and provide a glitchless interfaces. But
by doing so we may (in case of Allwinner SoCs we will) lockup some very
important functionality like CPU-frequency change while the UART port is
started up. In this case we won't have the data glitches.
2) just adjust the UART clock divider in case of reference clock rate
change (use the SiFive UART driver approach). In this case we may have the
data corruption.
3) somehow implement the algo: wait for the transfers to be completed,
lock UART interface (it's possible for Tx, but for Rx in case of no handshake
enabled it's simply impossible), permit the ref clock rate change,
adjust the UART divider, then unlock the UART interface. In this case the data
glitches still may happen (if no modem control is available or
handshakes are disabled).

As for the cases of Baikal-T1 UARTs the first solutions is the most suitable.
We don't lock anything valuable, since a base PLL output isn't directly
connected to any device and it's rate once setup isn't changed during the
system running. On the other hand I don't mind to implement the second
solution, even though it's prone to data glitches. Regarding the solution
3) I won't even try. It's too complicated, I don't have time and
test-infrastructure for this.

So Andy what do you think?
