Without seeing the code itself, it's almost impossible to guess.

Also note that udev does not create device nodes (hasn't for over a
decade).  devtmpfs in the kernel does that, udev just helps with
managing the permissions of created nodes if needed.

And why did you pick the ttyTX name?  That's already reserved for that
driver, you should use a new one, right?

And what hardware are you writing this driver for that we don't already
have a driver for it?

thanks,
