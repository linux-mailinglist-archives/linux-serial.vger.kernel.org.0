As mentioned in other threads. If we are changing the way we manage the
lifetime of the consoles I think it would be good to squash that change
down and simplify some of these cases.

Isn't this always set for this file (see Makefile)?

I think all the instances of this check (and the diligent
#else clauses are redundant).

static?

I know that causes no trouble for the current deinit() method does but 
I'd be more comfortable if the core printed this before calling deinit()?
