The problem you are reporting is not the problem that the printk rework
is trying to solve.

In your chart, v5.4.5-rt3 (PREEMPT_RT=y) is the only configuration that
is _not_ disabling hardware interrupts during UART activity. I would
guess your problem is due to interrupts being disabled for unacceptable
lengths of time. You need a low-latency system, so PREEMPT_RT=y _is_ the
correct (and only) solution if a verbose serial console is a must.

The printk rework focusses on making printk non-interfering by
decoupling console printing from printk() callers. However, the console
printing itself will still do just as much interrupt disabling as
before. That is driver-related, not printk-related.

The linux-rt patches (which include this printk rework) *are* being
ported to mainline now. My recommendation is to continue using the
linux-rt patches (with PREEMPT_RT=y) until PREEMPT_RT is available
mainline.
