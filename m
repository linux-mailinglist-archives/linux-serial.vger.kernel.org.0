Okay, will try to explore this option to have default serial port
client. Would this client be active in normal serial operation or only
active when we have kgdb active? One drawback I see for normal
operation could be power management as if user is not using serial
port and would like to disable corresponding clock in order to reduce
power consumption.

Agree.

Thanks for sharing your preferences. I will try to get a) sorted out first.

Overall I agree with your approaches to debug hard-lockup scenarios
but they might not be so trivial for kernel engineers who doesn't
posses kernel debugging experience as you do. :)

And I still think NMI aware magic sysrq is useful for scenarios such as:
- Try to get system information during hard-lockup rather than just
panic via hard-lockup detection.
- Do normal start/stop debugger activity on a core which was stuck in
hard-lockup.
- Random boot freezes which are not easily reproducible.

Yeah, this is on my TODO list to have a kgdb "knock" functionality to
be implemented via a common hook in serial core.

Thanks. I do look forward to your feedback.
