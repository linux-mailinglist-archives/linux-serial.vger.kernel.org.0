What if you also have a 16550 (in the PL) and give it the serial0 alias?
Or a UARTlite? The serialN alias is inappropriate to set the number for
ttyPSn. How are you supposed to create all of ttyPS0, ttyS0 and ttyUL0
using a single serial0 alias?

I think that it would be better if u-boot used a "console" alias.
