Sometimes the proper way is then backported too to stables, but it needs
to be checked how complicated that seems.

So basically you'd need 31f6bd7fad3b and at least a part of f9008285bb69?

I wonder if fifosize is always >= 1?

Would you happen to have a pointer for that 20 msecs is for HW 
workaround information bit

I'd kind of want to lower it and base the extra delay on frame time 
rather than, like you say, on arbitrary number.
