So I guess one point of evidence that the logic I have there is OK is
that it works.  :-P

...but also looking closer.  Maybe first it's important to understand
the REALLY WEIRD protocol that geni serial uses.  This was discovered
through a bunch of trial and error long ago when poking at how the
driver worked.

When you're reading from geni it essentially breaks things into
packets.  If you're midway through reading a packet of data and more
bytes come in then geni will hide them from you until you read the
whole packet.  I'm not totally sure the exact conditions for when it
decides to make a packet out of the data, but it's not important for
this discussion.

So when you read "RX_FIFO_WC" it tells you the total number of FIFO
words in the current packet.  That number will only ever go down.  A
packet is made up of some number of whole words plus one word that
could be a whole word or could be a partial word.  So if "RX_FIFO_WC"
says 4 it means you've got 3 whole words (3 * 4 = 12 bytes) and one
word that might be partial.  You can find out about that one partial
word (always the last word in the FIFO) by reading "RX_LAST" and
"RX_LAST_BYTE_VALID".

Once you finally read the last word in the FIFO then geni can tell you
about the next packet of data.

OK, so hopefully that made sense?

So qcom_geni_serial_handle_rx() is trying to read ALL bytes.  It first
figures out the total count of bytes and then reads them all.  That's
why it needs to look at RX_LAST all the time.  Also of note: RX_LAST
only ever applies to the last word in the FIFO.  If it was possible
for the word count to grow _before_ fully clearing out the FIFO then
it would be a race and software would never be able to tell which byte
RX_LAST applied to.

In the case of qcom_geni_serial_get_char() we don't want to read all
bytes because we don't have a place to put them.  We only want 1 byte
but sometimes we're forced to read 4 because of the whole
4-bytes-per-fifo-entry thing.  So we read one FIFO entry.  As long as
we're not reading the _last_ FIFO entry then geni won't start a new
packet.  So if RX_FIFO_WC > 1 and we read a byte then it'll go down by
1.  If RX_FIFO_WC == 1 then we're reading the last entry and geni is
allowed to start its next packet.

They are the same.
