I've just tested the pl330 patch and it looks good.
No longer get the WARN_ON_ONCE triggered in the 8250_dma driver so it looks like
Paused is correctly being set now and we're avoiding that path.
Wonder how many others dma drivers are afflicted in the same manner?
A quick grep seems to infer a lot more drivers set the pause function then have
something in them setting the status to DMA_PAUSED so probably good to keep the
8250 fix in also for the time being.
