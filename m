Ah, yes, you're right. I went back and compared with 6.9 and the effect
was indeed (often) that the machine felt sluggish when you hit ctrl-c to
interrupt something like dmesg and the driver would continue to print up
to 4k characters after that (e.g. 350 ms at 115200).

The idea here was to fix the lockup regression separately and then have
the third patch address the buffer flush failure, which could also be
backported without depending on the kfifo conversion.

But running with this series since yesterday, I realise there are still
some unresolved interaction with the console code, which can now trigger
a soft (instead of hard) lockup on reboot...

The idea did cross my mind, three levels of fifo...

Yeah, perhaps adding a smaller driver kfifo would work, but not sure how
clean it would be to implement.
