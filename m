There is no other way to determine what this device is other than
platform data?  Why not just set the vendor id in your device to a new
one and provide a correct setting in that new vendor data structure,
like all other devices for this chip have done before?

If it is the same id, and works differently, then that is a hardware
issue that you need to take up with your hardware designers to get fixed
as that is obviously a problem.
