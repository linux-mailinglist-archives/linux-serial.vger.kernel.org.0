Here are 2 dmesg snippets both are with a 6.3-rc2 kernel *without*
the revert and with your dmesg patch.

This is (part of) the HCI init without issues:

Here is another *successful* log with slightly different timing.

[  737.660532] hci_uart_bcm serial0-0: supply vbat not found, using dummy regulator
[  737.660681] hci_uart_bcm serial0-0: supply vddio not found, using dummy regulator

[  738.050142] Bluetooth: hci0: BCM: chip id 101

And here is the same part of the init sequence with an error:

[  771.247656] hci_uart_bcm serial0-0: supply vddio not found, using dummy regulator

[  771.632568] Bluetooth: hci0: Frame reassembly failed (-84)

Here is a full dmesg from several rmmod + modprobes, for the errors look for
"Frame reassembly failed".

Note this is from a different boot, I had to add log_buf_len=50M to be able
to grab a full dmesg:
