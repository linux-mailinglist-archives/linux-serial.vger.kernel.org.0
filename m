I was confused about the relation between SERIAL_8250_NR_UARTS and SERIAL_8250_RUNTIME_UARTS, and started digging through the code. The description of NR_UARTS clearly states that it controls the number of *supported* uarts, but I found that it was in fact controlled by RUNTIME_UARTS (8250.nr_uarts).

With the current behavior, ever setting NR_UARTS to anything different from RUNTIME_UARTS makes no sense, since the code only loops until RUNTIME_UARTS. Both Arch Linux and Fedora have come to the same conclusion, since they set both configs to 32. So now I have 32 useless /dev/ttyS* nodes on my laptop. If you run ubuntu on a machine with no uart hardware attached, you'll get 48 useless ttyS* nodes, of which only the first 32 will ever be available for real hardware.

If you look at uevents from 8250 when the designware ports are discovered, you'll see a DELETE of the built-in ttyS0 first, and then an ADD of the designware ttyS0. My understanding is that we should never have had that built-in ttyS0 in the first place?

The serial8250_find_match_or_unused() logic exists to relate non-discoverable ports to those discovered later through ACPI PNP. Some of my systems announces those built-in ports with ACPI, in which case the discovered ports are assigned to their "built-in" numbers.

I believe all systems running today announce these built-in ports through ACPI PNP, but they are still usable as early consoles, so this special logic is still needed?

My initial goal was to rely on discoverable ports only. Some of our systems have no built-in uarts, so the bash init script failed to even start, because the kernel command line had console=ttyS0, and bash tried to do set terminal attributes on it. I am only trying to fix the code "the right way", but that might not be possible without breaking numbering fo existing systems.

That would work for me. But shouldn't we clean up the SERIAL_8250_NR_UARTS vs. SERIAL_8250_RUNTIME_UARTS also?
