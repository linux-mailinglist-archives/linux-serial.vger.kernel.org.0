Odd that you state it this way, as this IS the RS-232 standard
requirement that was released in 1968, so codifying it into the POSIX
standard and using it in Linux today was a good thing so that we can use
Linux on hardware built for the standard.

To ignore the public, accepted, standard is to become an operating
system that does not follow the standard, which would not be a good
thing at all.

Again, this is not a "problem", it is a "let us use these pins for
something that they were not designed to be used for" type of thing.
You are wanting to ignore the well known and very common standard of the
past 53 years because you wish to reuse a UART pin as a GPIO pin, which
is not any sort of standardized thing at all.

Again, that is the standard, why wouldn't you want to do that?  To not
do that would be to break interoperability with millions of devices out
there (remember modems?)

Again, this is not a design bug, but the requirement that the OS follow
the 50+ year old documented and accepted standard for this hardware
interface.  This is designed properly.

Again, you are wanting a workaround for a limitation of your hardware
design, not a limitation of the RS-232 standard.  You are creating
non-compliant hardware and wish to control it in a way the hardware was
not originally intended to be controlled.

And that's fine, but don't speak of it as if we somehow messed up 53
years ago and no one has noticed it since then.  That's just
condencending to all of us who have maintained and worked with this
codebase and standard for these 50+ years.

On a personal note, I've been working on UARTs and RS-232 since "only"
1992 on a paid basis, and I have never heard of anyone objecting to this
portion of the RS-232 standard in a way to make it sound like it was
designed incorrectly this way.  But then again, I've only been doing
this for 30 years now, maybe I'm too new at this :)

Linux dropped those a long time ago for good reasons, let's not revisit
that design decision again please.

From what I recall with the original patch series, Johan is the author
of these, not you.  Rebasing and forwarding on is great, but please
never drop original authorship of patches, that's just rude, and in
some cases, ripe for legal worries.

Can you fix that all up, tone down the "this is all wrong" verbage, and
properly resend the series as a joined patch series (your emails are not
threaded properly at all and our tools can not find them correct, just
use 'git send-email' and that would solve it.) and then after the merge
window, I'll reconsider this series.

Also please document what has changed since Johan's original submission
to now, and why it should now be accepted when it was rejected then.

thanks,

greg k-h
