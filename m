So is FreeBSD 13.x a bad OS then, because it offers an *option* of
suppressing this particular standard-mandated behaviour?

I don't need to "remember" modems, I use them almost every day in my
test lab - but none of my proposed patch versions (nor FreeBSD's recent
CNO_RTSDTR feature addition) break interoperability with anything,
instead both FreeBSD's solution (for their OS) and my proposed Linux
patches merely provide an *option* for more specialized hw devices
that require different handling.

Dropped?  Are you saying that Linux once had them at some point in the
past?  If so, I was unaware of such history - I thought Linux never
had them to begin with, just like Classic UNIX (4.3BSD etc) never had
them either.  But in any case, was I ever asking for ttyXX.init
devices to be added to Linux?  No, I was not - instead I was merely
pointing out why a naive "straightforward" port of the new CNO_RTSDTR
termios flag from FreeBSD to Linux wouldn't work.

In the case of the 3 patches which originate from Johan (1/6, 2/6 and
4/6), I submitted them with the following attribution:

From: me
[...]
Co-developed-by: Johan
Signed-off-by: Johan
Signed-off-by: me

My reading of Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst told me
this was the correct protocol - but if I got it wrong, what is the
correct way then?  Specifically, what is the correct protocol when
(in this chronological order):

1) Developer A prepares a patch, and then drops it, i.e., does not
continue fighting to get it mainlined;

2) Developer B picks up A's patch and makes further modifications to
it, modifications which A might disagree with.

Please accept my apologies for missing the thread-linking headers - I
didn't realize until after I sent the series that they were critical
for reviewers.  I can resend the series with those thread-linking
headers added, and also changing the cover letter comments to be more
in line with your worldview - but first I need a clarification on the
authorship attribution issue above, as it is one thing which, if wrong
indeed, would need to be fixed right away.

> Also please document what has changed since Johan's original submission

The main change is not in the patch code, but in circumstances: in
between then and now, I have discovered that FreeBSD's solution
actually works correctly (unlike Johan's superficially-similar-sounding
termios flag proposal for Linux) in that it does NOT tell users to
"please suffer just once" on the very initial open of a freshly
plugged-in USB serial device.  Also FreeBSD's release process is
slower than Linux', and as a result of this slowness, the feature
addition in question only appeared in a release in 2021-04 - some
months after my previous attempts here - even though it was committed
to FreeBSD HEAD in 2019.  This new development in FreeBSD shines a
flashlight at Linux being the backward one here, and I was hoping that
this new change in circumstances would help create an impetus for
making the fix in Linux too.

As far as actual code changes between Johan's original patch version
and my current modified version, there is just one code change and one
significant comment change:

Code change: I have renamed the sysfs attribute from nordy to
manual_rtsdtr, with a similar name change for the internal flag, which
IMO makes it clearer what it is actually happening and why/when this
special mode might be needed.

Comment change: I removed all references to the termios flag idea
(which was Johan's repeatedly-stated longer-term goal and desire), as
that one can never work acceptably for the present problem in Linux,
or in any OS that lacks initial-state devices.

Oh, and there was one place in the code (DTR/RTS assertion in
serial_core.c, applying only to "hard" serial ports and not USB) which
Johan missed in his patch series, an omission which I only noticed
when preparing my current series - hence patch 3/6 is my original
work.
