uart_get_rs485_mode() is called from a driver's ->probe() hook and we
do not have a corresponding function that is called from a ->remove()
hook where we'd be able to relinquish rs485 resources we've acquired
on probe.

Of course I could add that but it would be more heavy-weight compared
to simply using devm_*().  Do you disagree?

devm_gpiod_put() isn't strictly necessary here.  It is only necessary
if one of the drivers would invoke uart_get_rs485_mode() multiple
times, which none of them does AFAICS.  It's just a safety measure.
I can drop it if that is preferred.

Good point.  It's also occurred to me now that reading the GPIO's
value after changing its direction to output is nonsense.  If anything
it ought to be read *before* changing the direction to output.
That would make sense in case the board has a pullup or pulldown on
the Termination Enable pin.  In other cases the pin may just float
and the value will be unpredictable.  However if I do not read the
pin, I'd have to choose either high or low as initial state.  Hm.
Let me check back with our hardware engineers today and see what they
recommend.

Thanks,

Lukas
