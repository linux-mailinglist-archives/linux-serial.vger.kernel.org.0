Why do you think so?  Such a requirement is not mentioned in the manual
of the PL010 (the UARTCR register is documented on page 44):

https://documentation-service.arm.com/static/5e8e246dfd977155116a54be


The manual of the successor, PL011, does contain a note on page 62 which
could be interpreted in the way you've written above.  However, in reality
this procedure appears to be unnecessary:

   "Program the control registers as follows:
    1. Disable the UART.
    2. Wait for the end of transmission or reception of the current
       character.
    3. Flush the transmit FIFO by setting the FEN bit to 0 in the Line
       Control Register, UARTLCR_H on page 3-12.
    4. Reprogram the UARTCR Register.
    5. Enable the UART."

This is not a fix, it's a cleanup.

Zeroing the CR register was cargo-culted to the PL011 driver and appears
to be not only unnecessary there but also harmful because it glitches
RS-485 RTS deassertion.

While digging in the git history to find out where the register write
originates from, I've come to the conclusion that it is unnecessary
in the PL010 driver as well.  So it appears to be bit rot that can be
removed.  Of course, I only have a PL011 available for testing and not
a PL010, so I cannot rule out 100% that the change does not cause
regressions.  Faced with the choice of letting the old driver bit rot
or risk a regression, I chose the latter.  I was hoping that Russell
might remember the reason for the register write and cry foul if my
change is not correct.

Thanks,

Lukas
