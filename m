OK let's make register_console() aware of the DEVNAME:X.Y options.
I like what you're suggesting towards the end of your message for
this.

That's to allow setting up a console when the driver is ready. So that 
we don't need to rely on the hardcoded device name deciphering at
console_setup() time. Maybe there's a better way to signal that though.

Preserving the ordering part is probably the smallest issue to deal with
here :) I agree we should try to make things simpler though and there
certainly are already lots of magic switches setting up the console.

Hmm not sure I get this issue though, when serial_base_add_prefcon() gets
called we know the device name. The "ttyS" parts are needed to avoid
relying on the hardcoded device name deciphering at console_setup() time.

If you're thinking about the serial8250_isa_init_ports() related calls,
the serial port mapping uses SERIAL_PORT_DFNS. And then a hardware
specific 8250 may take over at some point :)

Yes agreed, this will simplify things.

OK makes sense to me.

We can do that on driver probe time no problem. The issues are mostly
related to setting up things early on.
