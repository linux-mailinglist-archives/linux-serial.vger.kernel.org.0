Originally I had implemented the atomic flushing to release between
records. The problem is, as you mentioned, that the threaded printers
keep jumping back in. So you end up with lots of "replaying previous
printk message" from the atomic printer taking over all the time. This
is visible from a simple WARN() and it is ugly as hell.

Trying to make the output clean is quite tricky. Mainly because the
lower-prio context (which may or may not be the kthread printer) and the
higher-prio context need to understand each other's intentions and
somehow coordinate. My code started to look like I was implementing a
second layer of ownership (indended ownership) and/or some type of
bizarre scheduling with "printing-prio boosting" and/or "proxy console
ownership". It was a lot of code to make emergency blocks look sane.

In the end I decided to keep things simple and let the kthread printer
busy-wait, possibly with interrupts disabled. Your suggestion of adding
touch_nmi_watchdog() to nbcon_reacquire_nobuf() would also follow that
line of simplicity. The simplicity comes at the cost of possibly having
two CPUs dedicated to atomically flushing a single console (one that is
actually printing and one that is the busy-waiting normal-prio printer).

Note that for PREEMPT_RT the hardware interrupts are not actually
disabled. That is not an excuse to keep things this way, just a
reminder. Non-RT may also want to use that 2nd CPU for something useful,
in which case we would need the higher-prio printer to somehow
temporarily yield ownership to the lower-prio printer. And quite
frankly, that is not something the nbcon console ownership model was
designed to support.

If we can come up with an elegant way to handle the temporary transfer
while preserving clean output, I am all for it. I will take another look
and see if I can come up with a _proper_ (no duct tape) solution.
