Thanks for testing this. The above observations appear consistent with
LCR updates for your CH341 not taking effect (e.g. stuck at 8N1 unlike
the PL2303).

An easy way to test this is to send the letter 'q' (0x71) from CH341 to
PL2303 (in 8N1 mode). This should be received as 0xf1 if the CH341 is in
7N1 mode as the stop bit is interpreted as MSB, or as 0x71 if still in
8N1 mode.

Actually, LCR configuration wasn't supported before 4.10 either so the
only question would be if LCR control works at all with your chip
(except for the lost character).

I found this thread where Micahel provides some details after apparently
having disassembled the vendor driver:

	https://lore.kernel.org/all/2e80916d-1be8-dc0f-abf9-adc0feea1803@msgid.hansmi.ch/

Based on that (and the comment that made it into the driver), chips
before version 0x30 uses a different protocol for updating LCR so that
anything but 8N1 has indeed likely never worked for these chips. 

Could you try the patch below, which simply disables LCR updates for
older chips and which I believe you already confirmed works.

And then as a follow up, see if enabling the LCR update again has any
effect on the word size (e.g. rerun the test you did above, or the "q"
test I mentioned).

This may give an indication of how far we are from being able to support
LCR updates on older chips even this is not something we need to
implement now.

Subject: [PATCH] USB: serial: ch341: fix disabled rx timer on older devices

At least one older CH341 appears to have the RX timer enable bit
inverted so that setting it disables the RX timer and prevents the FIFO
from emptying until it is full.

Only set the RX timer enable bit for devices with version newer than
0x27 (even though this probably affects all pre-0x30 devices).

Also disable LCR updates for pre-0x30 devices which use a different
protocol and where the current register write causes the next received
character to be lost.

FIXME: split in two patches
