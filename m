Ah, I get it! I guess I would have described it as 1-byte per FIFO word.

Certainly that seems like something that's worth trying but, at least
in the past, I remember getting noticeably worse performance with it.
We used to be in that mode when kdb was enabled which I run with most
of the time. Depending on what you set the watermark level to you may
either end up spending a lot more resources servicing interrupts or
you might end up back in the case where you're stalling the transfer
because you couldn't service the interrupt fast enough. At 115.2, each
byte is about 87 microseconds, and draining a 16-byte FIFO is about
1.4ms. If you set the watermark at halfway then you'll get an
interrupt every 8 bytes or ~8x as many interrupts as with my patch
series. You'll also stall any time your interrupt latency is worse
than 694 microseconds. Hopefully that's not too often, though the
slowdowns you measured below make me worried.

Yeah, though you'd still have to make sure that the corner cases
worked OK. You'll have to pick _some_ sort of fixed transfer size and
make sure that all the special cases / console / kdb work if they show
up right at the end of the transfer.

I was also a bit curious if there could be power implications with
leaving an active TX command always in place. Perhaps geni wouldn't be
able to drop some resources? Do you happen to know?

That's really weird / unexpected. Your hardware should be fancier than
mine so, if anything, I'd expect it to be faster. Is there something
causing you really bad interrupt latency or something? ...or is some
clock misconfigured and "geni" is behaving sub-optimally?

...although it wouldn't explain the slowness, I'd at least be a little
curious if you've confirmed that you're running with a 16-word FIFO
depth. See the function geni_se_get_tx_fifo_depth() where newer
hardware can actually have larger FIFO depths.

Just in case it matters, I'd be curious if you have
`CONFIG_IRQ_TIME_ACCOUNTING=3Dy`

Oh: one last thing to confirm: do you have kernel console output
disabled for your tests? I've been doing tests with the kernel console
_not_ enabled over the serial port and just an agetty there. I could
believe things might be different if the kernel console was sending
messages over the same port.
