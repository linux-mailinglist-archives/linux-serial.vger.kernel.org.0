I assumed this is a sub-sub-architecture (something coming from
Layerscape or i.MX) but it seems it's not, therefore I don't mind having
separate entry in MAINTAINERS. The idea of in-file maintainers was for
specific boards and SoCs belonging to existing sub-architectures.

I agree with your following reasons.

The same can happen for DT bindings maintainers.
