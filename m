Thanks a lot for testing the fix and also for your invaluable help in 
narrowing down the problem. It would have been very hard to find the 
culprit otherwise.

Can I add your Tested-by tag before sending the official version of the

There might be others, but then the patch which covered the issue has gone
to stables already months ago and you're the first to report it AFAIK so 
perhaps not that wide-spread.

I'll think how to deal with this on 8250_dma side.
