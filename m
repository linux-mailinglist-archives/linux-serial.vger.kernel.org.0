Thanks for looking into it.

Not sure if we unconditionally want to set GENPD_FLAG_ACTIVE_WAKEUP as
the pm_domain.h describes it with "Instructs genpd to keep the PM domain
powered". The power domain should not force suspend automatically if there
are active runtime PM users even without that flag..

To me this still seems like a workaround because of the active runtime
PM usage count in the consumer driver :)

And GENPD_FLAG_ACTIVE_WAKEUP should not need to be configured separately
from the runtime PM usage count in this case. Sure there may be other
cases where GENPD_FLAG_ACTIVE_WAKEUP needs to be set dynamically, but
we should understand why the power domain code thinks it's OK to shut
down the domain if it has active users.

Tony
