Yes. The dma patches care about stopping DMA channel. This patch tries to
avoid that the channel runs out of usable buffers (aka dma periods).

Good question. In explanation i have missed an important point:
When using HW flowcontrol via RTS/CTS and the buffer is full CTS is used to
tell the remote device - here the Bluetooth chip - to stop sending data.
For a while this prevents losing of characters. But then the remote device
comes into trouble as its internal TX buffers runs over. Depends on the
device how it handles this case and if it recovers if data flow is enabled
again.

In case without HW flow control characters would be lost. Depends on the upper
layer what happens then.

Don't think so. The dma periods are raw data buffers. If one is full the next one
is being used. For the performance i don't see a significant difference between
using 1 kB buffers or 4 kB buffers.
